"Introduction | Terms of Reference for SO / TO Promotions Committee  Introduction  The Scientific and Technical Officers at the University of Cape Town provide an invaluable service to the university that spans a wide range of specialist activities. In recognition that each post is somewhat unique in its specialist requirements and to enable upward career mobility the university offers the opportunity for ad hominem promotion to this group of PASS staff. Performance management, career development and retention strategies are managed through this process.  The basis for deciding on promotion performance is captured in a performance standards document, which:   Differentiates the separate roles of the Scientific Officer (SO) and the Technical Officer (TO) in supporting teaching and/or research and/or management at the University; Distinguishes the performance indicators or outputs appropriate for each rank / level.   The performance standards document enables the following:   The candidate's representation of their performance as befits the core functions of their position; Objective evaluation of a candidate's performance level by the Promotions Committee, and assessment of whether it complies with an incremental standard; Referees' motivations of a candidate's performance against standardised indicators / outputs for a particular rank   Broader context  Given the role that SO / TOs play in supporting the academic endeavour, performance management, career development and retention strategies need to be explicit and transparent. The elements below show the broader context within which the promotion process resides.     If Then   the candidate and line manager wish to determine performance and development plans apply Development Dialogue (DD) process   the candidate consistently meets criteria for promotion by delivering outputs consistent with that of a higher position level follow promotion process   the candidate performs excellently in any particular year apply for an Exceeds Award   operational requirements of the position change / grow apply for position evaluation     Terms of Reference for SO / TO Promotions Committee  General rules and guidelines  The terms of reference should be understood in conjunction with the general rules and procedures for committees, as published in the Principal's Circular, and on the governance intranet.  General Provisions   The structure, function and powers of this committee, and any sub-committee, must be approved by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (DVC) with responsibility for faculties. The Promotions Committee must consider all applications (i.e. no applications may be suppressed). To utilise accepted criteria for the evaluation of SO / TO candidates for promotion.

"Rules and procedures for the appointment of heads of academic departments | The training of heads of academic departments | Acting heads of departments  The head of an academic department (HOD) occupies a pivotal position. He/she provides leadership and development where it matters most: in the academic department. Ensuring that his/her department flourishes as a well functioning academic unit is critical to our strategy.  The role, rights and responsibilities of heads of academic departments (HODS):    The head is responsible to his/her Dean for his/her work as head. The HOD must develop an operational plan for the department in consultation with the Dean.   The essence of headship is to give academic leadership to the department, to be concerned about its scholarship, its teaching and its standards, to develop its staff, and to grow it into a well-functioning academic unit.  The head should, as far as possible, consult his/her academic staff and delegate academic and other duties to them.  The head should also, where possible, consult the students in the department (or their representatives) at regular intervals. He/she must see to the election of class representatives.   It is the head's duty to represent the interests of the department in the faculty board, Senate and more widely.   The head should hold regular departmental seminars (at least once every two weeks) to promote intellectual vigour and rigour in the discipline.   While there are no prescriptive rules about departmental meetings, the HOD should hold them at least once every two months. Minutes should be kept and confirmed, and used for producing actions lists with deadlines. He/she should ensure a good flow of information to staff, especially as regards to policies and procedures.   Important issues include staff planning (include succession planning), staff development, the development of a departmental employment equity plan (in consultation with the Dean), and the carrying out of this plan. The head has to monitor the progress of staff serving probationary periods of appointment, and must carry out (or delegate) annual staff appraisals.   The head must also see to a range of administrative duties including:    Attend to or delegate routine academic and administrative matters relating to the department.   Ensure that nominations are made to the faculty board for the appointment of examiners for all courses offered by the department, and for higher degree candidates in the department.   Serve ex officio as a member of any committee of assessors appointed in respect of PhD candidates from the department, and for higher degree candidates in the department.   Decide leave for academic, technical and clerical staff in the department in accordance with HR rules and policies, and notify the Human Resources Department of any leave approved. (The head has power to decide on applications for special leave for periods of less than seven days, and may approve annual leave for the administrative and support staff of his/her department, but must notify the Human Resources Department of all leave granted.)   Make recommendations in regard to applications from members of staff for special leave for periods of seven days or longer, for study and research leave or contact leave, and on such other matters as may be decided from time to time.     The head is responsible for safety in his/her department. This includes ensuring that students, staff and visitors to the department are safeguarded and protected from physical risk, and that safe working standards and procedures are adhered to at all times. The head must see to it that he/she receives regular written reports from the safety officer(s) in the department.   The head is responsible for the control of expenditure against departmental budgets, and has the right to information about research budgets and research expenditure of members of the department.  The head is responsible for the equipment and assets assigned or on loan to the department and for the departmental asset register.   An acting head of a department has the rights, duties and responsibilities of a head, and serves as a member of any committee (together with the head if the head elects to continue to serve as a member) where the head's membership is ex officio.  If, in the absence of the substantive head, proposals are considered which would fundamentally affect the long term policies of the department (in regard to permanent staff appointments, curricula and structure degrees and courses), the Dean shall seek the head's views and ensure that these are communicated fully to the relevant committee.    Rules and procedures for the appointment of heads of academic departments    There is a single set of rules and procedures for the appointment of HODs.  Several HODs are appointed to permanent headships (this includes ballet, and some heads in the Faculty of Health Sciences). When the present incumbents step down from these headships, such procedures will be used to determine the appointment of the next head of department concerned.   The University's Employment Equity Policy applies at all levels within the University and appointment decisions must show commitment to the policy. Using the University's recruitment policy and procedures as a framework, every reasonable effort will be made to appoint suitable internal and external candidates from the designated groups to Headships of Academic Department positions.   The process for appointing a head begins with consultation. Deans generally consult members of the academic and senior support staff of the department (individually or in groups) and make recommendations to the executive officer charged with responsibility for the appointment of HODs. This must be done about six months in advance. The DVC will sometimes do this consulting, and include the Dean.   Professors and associate professors are contractually bound to make themselves available for appointment as HODs. Staff at the rank of senior lecturer may occasionally be appointed as HODs.   At least nine months before the term of office of an HOD is to expire, the Vice Chancellor's nominee (DVC responsible for academic headships) will initiate the process, and aim to complete this six months before the new HOD takes office.  The Dean (or DVC) will first consult the permanent academic staff of the department, and may then also consult the senior professional, administrative and support staff.  The aim is to find someone in the department who has:    The mix of scholarly strengths, inspirational leadership, recruiting skills, creativity and general management capacity required to develop a well-functioning academic unit.   The support of the department.   The vision essential to the department at a particular time.     After this process of consulting staff, and after consultating the DVC, the Dean must make a recommendation to the DVC (as the Vice Chancellor's nominee). The DVC, after further consultation (if considered necessary) shall either refer the nomination back to the Dean for re-consideration, or recommend to Council that it appoint the nominee to be head for a specified period.  Before the DVC recommends appointment, the DVC shall inform the Dean, the nominee, the current head, and the permanent academic staff.   The norm for a period of office will be five years, but where there are good reasons, appointment may be for a shorter period. As a general rule, a HOD should not take study and research leave during the first three years of a headship. Headships are renewable.   The nominee must present, either orally or in writing, an operational plan for the development of the department to the Dean and the DVC.  The Dean must ensure that this is done. The plan may be presented before the appointment is made, or before the nominee takes up the headship, or within the first six months of the headship, but not later than that.  The operational plan (modified where necessary in consultation with the Dean and the DVC) is intended to be a key tool for planning the work of headship. The Dean will also use it in subsequent performance appraisals.   An HOD who wishes to be relieved of the headship must ask the Dean and the DVC to consider this.   The Council may terminate a HODs headship before the term of office expires, if a committee recommends this. The Vice-Chancellor (or the Vice-Chancellor's nominee) may at any time appoint a committee, the composition of which shall be for a committee of review, to consider whether or not to recommend the termination of the headship. The committee shall submit a motivated recommendation to the Council.   Allowances, research support and leave privileges of heads of academic departments  The allowance and research (or other) support of each head of department shall be decided by the Dean from time to time, and is subject to budget.   The Dean may award an HOD an allowance which may be used in one or more of the following ways:    A headship allowance (a taxable addition to salary for the period for which given).   A research grant (e.g. to assist the HOD in maintaining his/her research during the period of headship).   A combination of the two above.    The allocation of the funds may not be changed for the duration of the headship.   The study and research leave accrual for HODs (in addition to standard accrual) is two weeks for each year as head, pro-rated.    The training of heads of academic departments    The Dean is responsible for the induction of each HOD, for arranging an induction programme for him/her, and for arranging for him/her to attend suitable courses. Each Dean is responsible for the staff development of the HODs in his/her faculty. This includes ensuring that each HOD is placed, through effective and appropriate support, in a position where he/she can teach, supervise research students, and maintain his/her academic profile. In many cases this may involve a downscaling of some of these activities, given the added responsibilities and tasks the HOD must perform.   Best practice models will differ across disciplines, but induction and training of HODs should cover:    Academic leadership (through vigorous planning, scanning of the national and international disciplinary landscape and visitors and conferences).   How best to organise regular, well-attended research seminars.   How to run effective, regular academic staff meetings (including senior support staff), which are minuted and lead to departmental action plans, and which are a forum for important discussions. Plenary departmental meetings should also be organised at least once a year.   The management of relationships with undergraduate and postgraduate students.   Contributions to academic programmes.   Curriculum development, taking into account university and system policy imperatives and trends.   Staff development, in particular regarding teaching, research and general intellectual growth.   Use of outside scholars for stimulation of students.   Library and IT services.   Space management at departmental level.   The management of facilities and equipment for research.   The management of fieldwork and community sites.    All factors should be supplemented by specific operational induction into HR management, research management, financial processes (fund raising) issues and communications.    Acting heads of departments    It is our policy to appoint an acting head in all cases where the head is (or is to be) absent, or when the headship is vacant.   The Dean appoints acting heads for periods of less than three months, and reports his/her decision to the Executive Director: HR and to the DVC.   The Vice-Chancellor (or the Vice-Chancellor's nominee, currently the DVC responsible for academic headships) appoints acting heads after taking the advice of the Dean, and after such consultation with staff as the DVC and the Dean consider necessary, for periods of between three and 12 months.   Should a vacancy exist for more than 12 months, a substantive rather than acting appointment is normally made.   The appointment of acting heads is reported for information in the PC.   Where an acting appointment is made for less than three months, no allowance is paid. The Dean decides the allowances and conditions under which an acting HOD will work for periods of between three and 12 months. No additional leave privileges attach to periods of acting headship.   Rules may be varied  Without in any way affecting the right of Council and Senate to alter, amend or make rules, it is recorded that these rules may be varied by Council from time to time after consultation with Senate.

"General | Principles | Informal action | Formal action | Suspension | The disciplinary enquiry | Appeal procedure  (This policy was consulted on between the University, the UCT Employees Union and NEHAWU, 2004)    General    This code contains general guidelines on the application of the disciplinary procedure and the promotion of fair labour practices pertaining to certain standards of conduct required from employees. While the code outlines the principles of fair procedure for the University and employees generally, it is of particular relevance to the individual employment relationship. This code applies to all employees as indicated above, and is designed to encourage all employees to achieve and maintain standards of conduct in accordance with their employment contract, specific position requirements and/or University rules. It is the responsibility of management to adopt disciplinary rules that establish the standard of conduct required from employees, and to ensure that all employees are informed of these standards, University policies and rules, and that they are exercised to all employees in procedurally and substantively fair and consistent manner. An employee is required to maintain certain standards of conduct. In particular, and without detracting from this general statement, an employee shall:   attend work regularly and punctually for the hours of work specified by the Head of Department within the maximum working hours laid down on the Human Resources website; perform his/her tasks and position responsibilities diligently; obey all lawful and reasonable University rules and job instructions issued by Management from time to time; conduct himself/herself with honesty and integrity; request permission in advance for any leave of absence, except on good cause; not absent himself/herself from duty without leave or permission, except on good cause; not behave insolently, provocatively, or in an intimidatory or aggressive manner towards any other staff member, student or visitor (which may include sexual harassment, racism, racial discrimination and racial harassment); not use intoxicating drugs while on duty (unless such drugs have been prescribed by a recognised medical practitioner and line management has been informed); not perform his/her duty under the influence of alcohol and/or intoxicating drugs (unless such drugs have been prescribed by a recognised medical practitioner and line management has been informed); not misbehave in such a way or be so negligent that this behaviour could endanger others or lead to the damage of the University's property, the disruption of activities or the impairment of the University's reputation; not intentionally disclose private and confidential information; not bring to, or house or use on University property any firearm, dangerous weapon or mock weapon (without prior permission).   In the event of an employee making himself/herself liable to disciplinary action by not maintaining acceptable standards of conduct, management reserves the right to resolve the complaint of unsatisfactory conduct quickly and with fairness. It is the objective of discipline in general, and the disciplinary procedure in particular to discourage misconduct in the first instance, but where misconduct occurred to correct unacceptable behaviour.   Principles   Disciplinary action will be based on the merits and circumstances of each case. At any stage in this procedure the employee will be informed by his/her immediate superior of the nature of the complaint against him/her, and will be given an opportunity to make his/her case before any decision is made. The notice of any meeting under this procedure must inform the employee of the nature of the complaint being made.   Informal action   It is the philosophy of the University to make every effort to deal with minor problems or incidences of misconduct through informal discussion and supervision in order to avoid the implementation of the formal procedure. Formal disciplinary action may not be invoked every time an employee breaks a rule or fails to meet a required standard. Unless the misconduct is sufficiently serious, the employee's supervisor/manager shall administer corrective action in the form of informal advice, counseling and verbal warnings. No record of verbal warning shall appear on an employee's personal file or formal disciplinary record. However, line managers can keep these records for their departmental use. Please note that this will require direct interaction between a staff member and the line manager.   Formal action   In the event of serious misconduct or repeated cases of an employee failing to meet required standards of conduct, the University shall take formal disciplinary action. For the purposes of this disciplinary procedure, serious misconduct includes, but is not limited to   intoxication or being under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicant malicious or intentional damage to University property theft, or attempted theft unauthorised possession of University property fraud (including the falsification of documentation and the misuse of leave privileges) gross negligence assault or threatened assault intimidation breach of confidentiality persistent late arrival, early departure and/or being absent from the workplace without leave during working hours failure / refusal to obey a reasonable and lawful instruction abscondment (unauthorised absence for 5 or more days) disregard of safety, health and fire regulations dishonesty or bribery.      Suspension   Formal disciplinary action will normally be taken only if there is prima facie evidence of misconduct. An investigation may be necessary to establish such evidence. An employee under formal investigation, who is asked to make a written statement, shall be advised by the Investigating Officer beforehand that the statement could be used in a disciplinary hearing. This shall include a person being informed of their right to representation prior to making a statement. The employee may elect not to make a written statement. An employee under investigation has the right to ask, and be told, the outcome of the investigation, at the end of the investigation. An employee may be suspended with full pay during the investigation where:   the University has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the employee has committed serious misconduct the University reasonably suspects that the investigation, or the University, would be prejudiced by the continued presence of the employee at the workplace.   Where an employee is suspended pending the outcome of an investigation, he/she shall be informed in writing the grounds for the suspension. When the investigation is over, he/she shall be informed in writing of the outcome of the investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer shall meet with the line manager and an HR Practitioner (appointed /delegated by the EDHR). Together they shall consider the evidence, and if it is sufficient to establish misconduct, draft charges shall be formulated. These as well as the evidence shall be referred to the Employee Relations Office which shall have the power to   confirm and/or amend the draft charges refer the matter back to the Investigating Officer for further investigation and/or consult further with the Investigating Officer, the HR Practitioner and the line manager to terminate the process if it is satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to establish the alleged misconduct. (with or without consultation in paragraph (ii) ). Where the investigation indicates misconduct on the part of an employee, a disciplinary enquiry shall be convened no later than 14 days after the investigation is complete.    If the line manager or the Employee Relations Office, is of the opinion that the conduct complained of is able to be resolved better through a process of mediation, it may be suggested to the complainant and the employee accused of alleged misconduct that resolution should be sought in terms of the University's Mediation policy. If the parties agree but are unable to resolve the matter in mediation, the line manager has the right to institute disciplinary proceedings within 14 days of the conclusion of mediation.    The disciplinary enquiry   Preliminaries   Where an employee has engaged in an act of misconduct he/she shall be notified in advance that he/she is required to attend a disciplinary enquiry. Sufficient time (at least two working days) shall be allowed for the employee to prepare his/her defense for the enquiry. The notification to the employee shall contain a detailed description of the allegations against the employee, and shall notify him/her of the following rights:   The right to be assisted or represented at the enquiry by a fellow University employee or a member of a University recognised employee representative body. Should the employee elect not to have a representative, this shall be recorded in the enquiry record. In the event that the representative of the employee's choice is not available, and provided sufficient notice of the enquiry has been given, the employee may nominate another representative to assist him/her, or make an application for a postponement that shall not be unreasonably withheld. Where a representative needs to represent an employee during working hours, whether or not he/she is a Shopsteward or Trade Union Representative, agreement shall be obtained between him/her and his/her supervisor/manager to be out of the workplace for these purposes.   The above-mentioned notification shall also, where possible, state who will chair the disciplinary enquiry. Should the employee and/or his/her representative believe that the chosen Chair should not hear the case, a motivation to this effect should be submitted to the nominated Chair, a copy of which is to be forwarded to the Employee Relations Office, at any time prior to the commencement of the hearing. The Chair will then decide whether or not to recuse him/herself (see 6b i, second point).   The enquiry: The participants   The chairperson   The chairperson of the enquiry shall approach the enquiry with an open and unbiased mind. He/she shall not have been directly involved in the issue or have conducted the investigation which led to the enquiry. Where the chairperson of the enquiry feels that he/she is unable to perform his/her duties impartially, he/she shall recuse himself/herself, and shall give written reasons for doing so to his/her Head of Department (administrative and support departments) or Dean and Head of Department (academic departments). The role of the chairperson shall be:   to ensure a fair and orderly procedure to open, conduct and close the proceedings to ensure that all parties fully understand the proceedings to attempt to establish the facts (which may necessitate identifying inconsistencies and probing conflicts in the evidence) to decide the matter only on the evidence presented to make two distinct decisions: - a finding regarding the allegations, and  - if the finding is one of guilt, then a decision on sanction.  to ensure that a record of the proceedings is kept. This record shall include the rationale for the chairperson's finding and, where sanction has been imposed, the rationale for the sanction.      The management representative   Management may nominate a representative to present its case, providing that such a representative is a University employee. The Management representative shall be required to lead evidence in support of the allegation against the employee. The Management representative shall examine Management witnesses as well as cross-examine witnesses called by the employee, or his/her representative. The Management representative shall be allowed to be present throughout the enquiry but shall not be party to the decision-making process.   The Human Resources Department representative   A member of the Human Resources Department shall be present at all disciplinary enquiries where an employee has been accused of serious misconduct. However, the absence of a member of the Human Resources Department at an enquiry shall not prejudice the holding of the enquiry. The primary role of the Human Resources Department shall be   to advise the chairperson and the Management representative where necessary regarding the implementation and interpretation of University policy and procedures; and to advise the chairperson on the relevant CCMA, Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court rulings and University precedent.   The Human Resources Department representative shall also be allowed to ask such pertinent questions as might clarify substantive issues in the case. The Human Resources Department representative's role is not to be confused with that of the chairperson or Management representative. He/she shall not be party to the decision-making process.   The employee and the employee representative   The employee has the right to be assisted by a representative of his/her choice provided that representative is a University employee. The employee and his/her representative shall be present throughout the enquiry. The employee and his/her representative shall be permitted to lead evidence in defense of his/her case, cross-examine Management's witnesses and lead further witnesses.   Witnesses   All witnesses in the enquiry shall be required to attend in person, even in cases where they have submitted written statements, to allow for the accused employee and his/her representative to cross-examine the evidence supplied. Where practicable, the evidence against the employee shall be presented orally by the person/s who have personal knowledge of the facts to which they testify. In disciplinary cases such as those involving violence or intimidation, where the complainant/s or witness/es can reasonably be expected to fear for their or their family's safety, special arrangements may be introduced to protect identities, but every effort shall be made to ensure procedural fairness. In exceptional circumstances, a witness may request permission from the chairperson to be accompanied by a support person (e.g. in a harassment case).     The enquiry: The process   The enquiry shall be divided into two parts   consideration of the evidence presented, and where a finding of guilty is reached, the enquiry shall proceed to  consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.   In considering the evidence, the chairperson shall take account of all relevant evidence, as presented. The chairperson of the enquiry shall then make a finding, on the charges or lesser charges consistent with the circumstances in the case. The findings shall be based on a balance of probabilities. If the facts do not support the allegation made, the enquiry shall be closed and the employee cleared of the specific allegation. Where a finding of guilty is noted, the employee shall be informed and the enquiry shall proceed. When a finding of guilty is made the employee and his/her representative shall be given the opportunity to lead evidence in mitigation of the possible adverse sanction. The Management representative shall be given the opportunity to lead evidence of any aggravating circumstances. In addition to considering any evidence led in terms of 6c iv and 6c v above, and prior to making a decision on sanction, the chairperson of the enquiry shall have regard to any other mitigating and aggravating circumstances contained in the personal file of the employee. The chairperson of the enquiry shall convey his/her decision on sanction at the end of the enquiry. The decision shall be given to the employee and his/her representative in writing as soon as possible after the enquiry. In the case of the sanction being dismissal, the chairperson of the enquiry shall sign the letter notifying the employee of his/her dismissal. The chairperson of the enquiry shall produce a written report of the salient points in the enquiry. At the request of the employee, a copy of the report shall be sent to him/her or the employee's representative within 2 working days. Any delay on Management's part will extend the periods referred to in paragraph 7.   Possible sanctions   The sanction applied shall depend on   the seriousness of the case, and mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances (including the employee's previous record and especially repeated offences of the same or similar nature).   Formal disciplinary action may take the form of one of the following sanctions   written warning final written warning consolidated final warning dismissal with notice summary dismissal.   Written warnings shall be valid for a specified period of not less than six months. Final written warnings shall normally be valid for a specified period of not less than twelve months. In cases that are sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal, but an alternative to dismissal is considered, a final written warning for a period longer than twelve months could be issued. An employee receiving a written warning or a final written warning should sign it in acknowledgement of receipt. Such signature shall not prevent or in any way influence an appeal. If the employee refuses to sign the warning, this fact shall be recorded on the warning and signed by a witness. Refusal to sign is not a disciplinary offence. Dismissal may be warranted where   an employee has failed to respond to corrective action, i.e. misconduct while there is a current final written warning on file, or an employee continuously engages in various forms of unrelated misconduct for which he/she have current warnings, which have been consolidated into a final written warning. the misconduct is serious, such that it is not reasonable for the employment relationship to be continued.   The employee, in the case of dismissal with notice, shall subject to the chairperson's discretion be paid out in lieu of notice, up to the period as reflected in the employee's contract of employment. Where there has been gross misconduct or a complete breach of the employment contract (e.g. theft, fraud), an employee may be summarily dismissed. Dismissal is with immediate effect and the employee shall be paid up to the date of dismissal only.   Administration   An employee who is issued with a written, final written or consolidated final written warning would only be required to sign it in acknowledgement of receipt. The employee's signature on the warning form shall not prevent or in any way influence an appeal against the sanction. If the employee refuses to sign receipt of the warning, this fact shall be recorded on the warning form and signed by a witness. Refusal to sign a warning form is not a disciplinary offence. The original warning shall be given to the employee, one copy shall be filed on the employee's personal file in the Central Registry in the Human Resources Department, one copy kept by the supervisor/manager and a copy issued to the Employee Relations Office for its records. Upon expiry of the period of the warning, the employee may approach the supervisor/manager and ask for the copy of the warning kept by the supervisor/manager. No record of the warning shall thereafter be kept in the files of the supervisor/manager. Only the personal file kept in the central Registry of the Human Resources Department shall retain the ""expired"" warning forms.      Appeal procedure   An employee has the right, either personally or through his/her representative, to appeal against any formal disciplinary action. The basis for the appeal must be stated and may include but is not limited to   jurisdiction procedural irregularities evidentiary problems factual findings of the chairperson problems surrounding the sanction imposed problems relating to the impartiality of the chairperson.   In the case of a written warning, the appeal should be lodged with the senior of the person who issued the warning. The appeal should be lodged within 3 (three) working days of the issue of the warning. The senior addressed or, if appropriate, another line manager shall either hold an oral hearing or consider the matter on papers in order to decide the case. If the chairperson of the appeal decides to hold an oral hearing, he/she shall convene a hearing within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. In the case of a dismissal, the appeal should be lodged in writing with the Registrar, via the Employee Relations Office of the Human Resources Department, within 7 (seven) working days of the dismissal. The Registrar, or Registrar's nominee, shall either consider the matter on papers or convene an oral hearing in order to decide the case. The hearing shall be convened within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. The chairperson of the appeal may accept a notice of appeal lodged after the expiry of the said time limits, on good cause shown by the employee. The chairperson of the appeal shall not have been directly involved in the original enquiry or the investigation. The appeal hearing shall consider all the issues raised on the grounds of notice of appeal, including where relevant   procedural issues the finding of the original enquiry, and sanction.   A decision shall be given within 7 (seven) working days of receipt of the appeal if no hearing is called, or within 7 (seven) working days of the conclusion of the appeal hearing. This decision will be given as soon as possible thereafter in writing. This decision shall be final and shall indicate the end of the internal disciplinary procedure.

"Preamble | General principles | The authority to disestablish a post | Process for disestablishing an occupied post | Process for disestablishing one or more similar posts | Decision to disestablish an occupied post | Consultation on disestablishing an occupied post | Giving notice to incumbent | Severance pay | Annexure A: The redeployment list and the redeployment process  This is the procedural agreement between the University of Cape Town and the UCT Employees Union and NEHAWU on the retrenchment of permanent administrative and support staff in payclasses 1 to 12.   Preamble   The procedures outlined in this policy are designed to deal with the Employee Relations implications of the dismissing of one or more employees based on the University's operational requirements. The University is committed to not terminate the services of its employees without good reason, and accepts that staff need security of employment. The University, however, also recognises that its operational and financial needs may, from time to time, require a reduction in expenditure, which cannot be achieved without a reduction in staffing levels. Wherever possible, the University intends achieving this without embarking on a retrenchment or redundancy exercise, through the process of redeploying affected employees. In the event of the University being unable to redeploy an employee, the University undertakes to retrench the employee, in line with provisions of this policy and Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, as amended from time to time. These procedures distinguish between:  the process for disestablishing an occupied post the process for redeploying a staff member the process for retrenching the incumbent of a disestablished post, if there is no alternative     General principles   The University is committed to retaining the services of, and offering ongoing opportunities to existing staff members in ways that are consistent with achieving the University's Employment Equity goals. This policy aims to minimise retrenchment by ensuring a fair redundancy process and offering redeployment as an alternative to involuntary retrenchment where positions are identified as surplus to requirements. The University will, where the employee whose continued employment may be affected by the University contemplating restructuring a PASS Department, inform the Union of the impending retrenchments, and in the event that the Union is the chosen representative, involve them in all consultations with the employee(s). The University will notify and consult recognised Unions/representatives of employees, whenever the nature of the employee's position changes, and the changes effected may likely result in the post becoming redundant. The University and the representatives of the affected employees shall enter into consultation through a process of joint consensus-seeking, with a view to reach consensus on appropriate measures aimed at:  avoiding the retrenchment; minimising the number of retrenchments; mitigating the adverse effects of the retrenchments; and agreeing on method of selecting the employee to be dismissed.     The authority to disestablish a post (This paragraph is included in the procedure for completeness but does not form part of the agreement, and management may change authorities.)   The authority to disestablish a post, whether it is an occupied or vacant, is the Dean in the case of all posts in a faculty, or the Head of Department in the case of support departments. Where the Chair of the Employee Relations Management Committee (ERMC) is the authority for the disestablishment of an occupied post in his/her department, the authority to disestablish shifts to the ERMC. Any proposal to disestablish an occupied post must be supported by the relevant manager referred to in sub item 3a above, prior to the proposal being referred to the Chair of the ERMC. Authority to disestablish an occupied post rests with the Chair of the ERMC, after the process of consultation, as outlined in clause 4 below, has been followed.   Process for disestablishing an occupied post  When a line manager contemplates making a request to his/her Head of Department for the disestablishment of an occupied post, he/she shall first consult employees (and their representative/s) who may be affected by way of changes to their position descriptions and conditions of service. The line manager must thereafter make an initial proposal, on operational grounds to the relevant Head of Department. If the Head of Department refuses the proposal, the matter ends there. If the relevant Head of Department agrees that sound operational reasons exists for the disestablishment of the occupied post, the line manager shall commence the process of consultation as outlined in clause 7 below.   Process for disestablishing one or more similar posts  When the Chair of the ERMC is required to disestablish one or more of a number of similar posts, that process to be followed will involve consultation with all staff and their chosen representatives on the selection criteria to be used in determining whom to retrench in the absence of alternatives being found. The process must include the following steps:  The HR Representative shall notify all the incumbents of the group holding similar posts, and their chosen representatives, in writing, of the number of posts to be disestablished, and the number remaining. The line management, in consultation with the HR Representative shall set out line management's proposals on the method and criteria for the selection of staff to be retained, redeployed or retrenched, based on the agreed criteria with their representatives. Should there be no agreement on the criteria to be used, the University will nonetheless apply criteria it considers to be fair. Among a list of inexhaustive criteria the consulting parties may use, are the following:  Operational requirements; Experience relative to the current position; Qualifications; Skills and training; Length of service; Employment Equity needs and objectives of department; Work performance.   The University shall give the incumbents and their representatives at least two (2) weeks to make representations on alternatives to the proposal. Line management, advised by the HR representative, shall consider all such representations, and may amend the original proposal, if so warranted. A copy of the final proposal to the incumbents and their representatives on the outcome of their representations made, giving clear reasons for accepting and/or rejecting any of these representations, shall be made at least one (1) week before the Chair of the ERMC considers the selection criteria, as agreed upon by the consulting parties. Having had regard for the process of consultation had by the consulting parties, the Chair of the ERMC may approve or reject the proposal, having appraised him/herself fully with the rationale for such, supplying reasons for his/her approving or rejecting same.     Decision to disestablish an occupied post  Once consultation has been concluded, whether or not consensus has been reached, the Head of Department will make a formal proposal to the Chair of ERMC for the disestablishment of the occupied post, the proposal must be copied immediately to the affected employee and his/her chosen representative. Upon receipt of the proposal, the Chair of the ERMC may either:  Refuse permission; Refer the proposal back for further motivation; or Ask a representative from the Human Resources Department (HR Representative) together with relevant line management to have further consultation with the incumbent and his/her chosen representative.   In the event of the Chair of the ERMC opting for 6b iii above , then the HR Representative and line management shall formally meet with and brief the incumbent and his/her representative on the proposal, including reasons for the proposed change, and shall give the incumbent and his/her representative at least three (3) weeks to make representations on the proposal.   Consultation on disestablishing an occupied post  When the University contemplates disestablishing one or more occupied posts for reasons based on the University's operational requirements, and this disestablishment may lead to possible retrenchment of an employee, line management, advised by an HR Representative shall consult:  any person whom the employer is required to consult in terms of a collective agreement; any registered trade union whose members are likely to be affected by the proposed retrenchment; if the affected employee is not a member of a trade union, any representative nominated for that purpose, provided that this representative is a member of the University's staff.   The University, via the relevant line management, and with the assistance of an HR Representative shall issue a written notice inviting the affected employee and his/her chosen representative to consult with it and disclose in writing all relevant information, including but not limited to:  the reasons for the proposed disestablishment and possible retrenchment; the alternatives the University considered before proposing the disestablishment, and the reasons for rejecting each of those alternatives; the number of employees likely to be affected and the payclasses in which they are employed;   The Chair of the ERMC will consider and respond to the representations made by the incumbent and his/her chosen representative, if the University disagrees with them, the University will state the reasons for disagreeing or rejecting them.   Giving notice to incumbent  The Chair of the ERMC shall give notice to the affected incumbent and his/her chosen representative, in writing, of the decision to disestablish the post, and further notify him/her that he/she have to put on three (3) months' notice that he/she would be retrenched if the University fails to redeploy him/her within this period. Staff will have an option of staying on the redeployment list for a further three (3) months after involuntary retrenchment has been effected, and in this period (unpaid) the University shall endeavour to continue seeking alternative redeployment opportunities. The notice shall include any alternatives to dismissal already considered by the management and reasons for rejecting such alternatives. The HR Representative shall notify the incumbents of the severance pay and estimated retirement fund benefit that would be paid out in the event of retrenchment. The HR Representative shall immediately place the incumbent's name on the redeployment list. Details of how redeployment will be facilitated and the outcome thereof are contained in Annexure A hereto. The HR Representative shall at all times make the incumbent and his/her chosen representative aware of vacancies that arise or may arise. If no redeployment or other alternative is achieved prior to the expiry of the notice period, the appointment will terminate and severance pay will be paid out. The notice to retrench may be withdrawn if an alternative post is found in the first half of the notice period. However, after this period, the incumbent will have the option of any alternative post offered or the retrenchment package.   Severance pay This provision covers severance pay in the event of retrenchment.   Severance pay will be paid in a lump sum payment. Staff will have the following options:  5% of annual remuneration package (COE) x years of service, up to a maximum of one year's remuneration. OR  4% of annual remuneration package (COE) x years of service + long leave due, up to a maximum of one year's remuneration. OR  1 week's remuneration package for each year of service (no ceiling).   Definition  ""Remuneration Package"" includes the salary budget, the medical aid budget, the UCTRF budget, HOD allowances, and the cash value of any payment in kind that forms part of the staff member's standard remuneration. It excludes:  Gratuities Allowances paid for the purposes of enabling an employee to work (e.g.traveling allowances) Any discretionary payments not directly related to the employee's hours of work or performance.   ""Years of continuous service"" will be taken as years, rounded to one decimal place (i.e. the definition in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act).   In addition, the following will be due:  payment from the relevant pension or retirement fund; pro rata service bonus (where applicable); pay in lieu of annual leave owing.   Staff are required to work their notice period, but will be granted reasonable time-off from duty to seek alternative employment. Should staff wish to attend courses offered by UCT's Information and Communication Technology Services Department and the Staff Learning Programme (offered by Human Resources Development), they will be able to so on condition that they pay the staff rate for the course, and that no current staff member will be prejudiced i.e. Availability of space in a course. This will be valid for 12 months from the date of termination of service. Staff and dependants, who were studying at UCT prior to the termination of the staff member's contract, will continue to pay the staff tuition rate for up to 3 years or until the current course/degree has been completed, whichever is the shorter period. Staff will receive R1000 as a contribution towards costs incurred for financial and other forms of advice and counseling. This may however be utilised at the staff member's discretion.     Annexure A  The redeployment list and the redeployment process   An incumbent on the redeployment list is defined as a ""likely"" candidate for a vacant post if the vacant post is in the same payclass as the incumbent, or is one or two payclasses above and/or below the payclass of the incumbent. In the event that a staff member in the redeployment list is redeployed to a post at the same level, above or below the current level, a new contract reflecting the existing reality will be entered into between the individual and the University. Before advertising a post, the Human Resources Department, will invite the Head of Department seeking to fill a vacancy to consider and, where appropriate, interview suitably qualified candidates on the redeployment list. Regard shall be had for the potential of the candidate to be trained within a reasonable period of time to fully fulfill the requirements of the position. It remains the decision of the Heads of Department to appoint or not to appoint a ""likely"" candidate on the redeployment list to a vacant post. If a ""likely"" candidate is considered by the Head of Department not to be suitable, and is not appointed, the onus is on the Head of Department to give written reasons to the Chair of the ERMC. Copies of such reasons shall be served on the ""likely"" candidate and the Union/representative. Staff on the redeployment list who are interviewed will be given the option of completing a post interview questionnaire. (Annexure B - not on the web but available from the employee relations section of the Human Resources Department and the Union.) In line with the policy of giving preference to the staff on the redeployment list, vacant posts for which there are ""likely"" candidates on the redeployment list shall not be advertised, internally or externally until the Employee Relations Office has established that no candidate on the redeployment list is suitable.

Annual leave is granted at times mutually agreed between the staff member and his or her line manager consistent with reasonable operational requirements.  From a wellness point of view, staff are encouraged to take their annual leave, as it reduces stress and improves quality of work. Sick leave is provided in times of illness or injury to ensure that our staff do not have to work while sick.  Applicable to   Senior leadership group (VC, DVCs, Deans, EDs, GSB Director, Registrar) All academic and PASS staff on permanent conditions of service whether in full- or part-time employment Joint staff (with conditions) All academic and PASS staff on fixed-term contracts (T1 and T2 leave conditions) Post-retirement contracts (usually T1 leave conditions) Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff (staff of a temporary nature, with variable hours) Internships and learnerships (usually T1 leave conditions)   Not applicable to   Volunteers Visiting academics and other staff Staff not on UCT conditions of service, for example SHAWCO. Time off as a result of injury on duty is covered by the Occupational health policy.   Policy details  Definition | General | Annual leave | Sick leave | Parental leave | Family responsibility leave | Special leave | Payment and transfer of leave | Unpaid leave | Absence without leave (AWOL)   Definition    1.1. There is an obligation on the staff member to be working in order to be remunerated. Leave is permission, usually from the line manager, to be away from work - under one of the leave categories contained in this policy.    General   2.1. The University closes on public holidays, when the only staff required to report for duty are those in whose areas services must be maintained. These include, but are not limited to, Campus Protection Services, the residences and the medical school.  2.2. Leave is managed by line managers and heads of department, who approve leave according to operational requirements and in the interests of staff wellness. In particular, the amount of untaken leave needs to be monitored as this is a liability on departmental budgets.  2.3. In the case of extended sick leave due to poor health, proper leave records are necessary to access the Income Continuation and Rehabilitation benefit.  2.4. Proper recording of sick and annual leave is essential as an accurate record is required in situations of poor performance, or when a disciplinary process becomes necessary.    Annual leave   Annual leave subsections:   3.1 Permanent and T2 academic and joint staff 3.2 Permanent and T2 PASS staff 3.3 PASS and academic staff on T1 contracts 3.4 Part time staff and parts of a month 3.5 Conversion of annual to sick leave 3.6 Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    3.1. Permanent and T2 academic and joint staff    Accrual and carry over   3.1.1. The number of annual leave days which accrue each year is 22, to be taken each calendar year in agreement with the Head of Department in general and with the Dean for Heads of Department. In setting the guidelines of 22 days per annum, the University recognises that academics ordinarily do not work during the period between Christmas and New Year (27 December – 31 December). Where the staff member is required to work in this period, the corresponding number of working days is granted as leave during the year, to be arranged in advance as no leave is carried forward to the following year.   Application and taking of annual leave   3.1.2. Academic staff wishing to take annual leave must obtain approval from the Head of Department. A form is not required centrally but records must be kept in the department.   3.1.3. Approval of leave rests with the line manager or HOD provided that operational requirements allow for it. If a Head of Department, approval is given by the Dean and if a Dean by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor nominated for this purpose by the Vice-Chancellor.     3.2. Permanent and T2 PASS staff    Accrual and carry over   3.2.1. Annual leave accrues monthly at the rate of 2.17 or 2.83 days, based on 26 or 34 working days per annum in calendar year cycles (see summary table).   3.2.2. Depending on the level of staff, annual leave is made up of (see summary table):   PC 1 - 12: 19 compulsory leave days and 7 accumulative leave days PC 13 peromnes grade 4-5: 18 compulsory leave days and 8 accumulative leave days Executive Directors and The Registrar: 26 compulsory leave days and 8 accumulative leave days    3.2.3. Staff employed prior to 1977 who are entitled to long leave (a historical type of leave which has been discontinued) are not entitled to accumulative annual leave.   3.2.4. A staff member may not take leave before it has accrued. He or she may take annual leave in the year in which he or she earns it, or in the calendar year following the year in which he or she earns it (for T2, by end of June of the following year).    Example A member of staff who joins on 1 January of a given year will be allowed to take annual leave that has accrued to a particular moment in time. In other words, if he or she wanted to take leave in June, 13 days would be available (2.17 days per month x 6 months).     3.2.5. Accrued compulsory annual leave not taken by the end of the following calendar year is lost (for T2, by end of June of the following year), unless the Head of Department can show, via a written motivation to the satisfaction of the Executive Director: HR that there were good operational reasons why the leave could not be taken. Leave to be postponed in this way must be requested before completion of the calendar year concerned and must be taken as early as possible in the following year.   3.2.6. Accumulative annual leave (permanent only, not T2) has the following maximums, which may be carried over indefinitely:     Staff grouping Maximum accumulative leave   PC 1-4 up to 28   PC 5-12 up to 42   PC 13 PG 4-5 PC 13 PG 3 (EDs and Registrar) up to 50      3.2.7. Once the maximum has been reached, accumulative leave is accrued as compulsory leave and must be used as per 3.2.5.   Application for annual leave   3.2.8. PASS staff wishing to take annual leave must apply to their line manager, using the standard leave application form (HR140).   3.2.9. The decision to grant leave rests with the line manager provided that operational requirements reasonably allow for it and the staff member has leave due to him/her.   Taking of leave   3.2.10. The maximum leave that can be taken at any one time is 50 working days.   3.2.11. Staff who take leave between the Day of Goodwill (26th December) and New Year's day must apply for leave in the usual way.   3.2.12. A staff member is not permitted to take annual leave in excess of his or her total leave credit (i.e. current accrual of compulsory leave plus any accumulated leave). Any leave taken in excess of this will be unpaid leave (see: Unpaid leave).   3.2.13. A Head of Department may refuse to grant leave during a staff member's notice period, prior to resignation.     3.3. PASS and academic staff on T1 contracts    3.3.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, 1.25 days per month worked (or 15 working days per year from the anniversary date) is accrued as annual leave.   3.3.2. Only leave which has accrued to date may be taken as annual leave.     3.4. Part-time staff and parts of a month    3.4.1. For part-time staff, leave is accrued as per 3.1. (academic and joint staff), 3.2. (PASS) or 3.3. (T1 contracts) and pro-rated as follows:     Working.. Earns..   1 day per week 20% of the full-time entitlement   2 days per week 40% of the full-time entitlement   3 days per week 60% of the full-time entitlement   4 days per week 80% of the full-time entitlement   This calculation also applies to the other types of leave.      3.4.2. If a person works part of a month, annual leave entitlement is calculated as follows:     Formula   Full-time entitlement   ÷ Calendar days in the month   x Calendar days employed   Worked example: A staff member starts work on November 10.   2.17 days   ÷ 30 days   x 21 days   = 1.5 days [Result]        3.5. Conversion of annual leave to sick leave    3.5.1. Annual leave may be converted to sick leave under exceptional circumstances only. A written motivation with HOD/line manager’s support must be supplied as well as a medical certificate, and final approval rests with the EDHR.     3.6. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    3.6.1. In line with the BCEA, leave accrues at the rate of 1 hour per 17 hours worked, provided the staff member works more than 24 hours in the month.   3.6.2. Leave may be taken subject to approval during the contract, or the hours claimed as leave pay on a monthly basis.      Sick leave   4.1. Legal definitions    4.1.1. Ill-health incapacity is the failure or inability of a staff member to work according to the requirements of the position as a result of ill-health (including mental ill-health) or injury. In the case of incapacity for reasons of ill-health or injury, no fault can be attributed to the staff member, and is not the same as poor performance incapacity.   4.1.2. Incapacity due to ill health or injury is assessed relative to the requirements of the position. It can be a partial, temporary, short-term, long-term, or permanent condition and is managed accordingly. See also: Disability through ill health.   4.1.3. Sick leave is provided for in cases of temporary, short-term incapacity for reasons of ill health or injury as per 4.1.1.   4.1.4. Sick leave is not provided if a staff member is fit to work.     4.2. Accruals: Permanent PASS and academic staff    4.2.1. A staff member may be granted sick leave on full pay for a total of not more than 30 calendar days during the first year of service, for a total of not more than 60 calendar days during the first two years of service, and for a total of not more than 90 calendar days during the first three years of service.   4.2.2. A person who has completed at least three years of service may, in each cycle of six years from the date of appointment, be granted sick leave for a total of 180 calendar days of which not more than 90 shall be on full pay and the remainder on half pay.  Summary: A permanent staff member earns 30 calendar days full pay sick leave per annum on the anniversary date for the first 3 years of the 6 year cycle. He or she earns 30 calendar days half pay sick leave per annum for years 4 to 6 of the 6 year cycle. In total this will be 90 calendar days full pay and 90 calendar days half pay over 6 years. In the second and subsequent cycles, all sick leave accrues in advance.     4.3. Accruals: PASS and academic staff on T1/T2 contracts    4.3.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, 1 day per month worked is accrued as sick leave.   4.3.2. Only sick leave which has accrued to date may be taken.     4.4. Accruals: Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    4.4.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, leave accrues at the rate of 1 day paid sick leave per 26 days worked. This will be prorated according to the number of hours worked.   4.4.2. Only sick leave which has accrued to date may be taken.     4.5. Application for sick leave    4.5.1. If a staff member becomes unable to perform in his or her position due to ill health or injury (see Section 4.1 Legal definitions) during the course of the working day, at whatever time, and is given leave to go home by his or her line manager, a full day’s sick leave must be taken.   4.5.2. All staff members must produce a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner in respect of any sick leave for periods of more than two days. At the discretion of the Head of Department, a medical certificate may be required for all periods of sick leave especially where there is a pattern or suspicion of abuse.   4.5.3. The diagnosis indicated on the certificate need not be fully disclosed but must be within the expected competencies and permitted practices for the licensed individual who is issuing it. The certificate must clearly state that the person is unfit for work (see Section 4.1 Legal definitions) and give the dates for which he or she is booked off.   4.5.4. A staff member who is absent from work owing to injury or illness must immediately make every effort to inform his or her head of department or line manager of the reason for the absence and he or she must continue to do so daily until a medical certificate, which specifies the period of sick leave, has been provided. This practice applies to any day which is not covered by a sick leave certificate.   4.5.5. On returning to work, the sick leave taken must be reported using form HR140.     4.6. When sick leave runs out    4.6.1. The following measures may be possible in exceptional circumstances when sick leave runs out, with a written motivation and HOD/line manager’s support:    sick leave may be taken as unpaid and/or;   available half pay sick leave may be converted to full pay sick leave and/or;   annual leave may be recorded as sick leave at the rate of 1 day’s annual leave for 1 day’s sick leave if annual leave is available.     4.6.2. Final approval for the above measures lies with the Executive Director: Human Resources and will not, as a general rule, be granted unless:    a medical certificate has been provided; and   the period of absence on sick leave is longer than 14 days; and   the absence on sick leave was the result of serious illness or injury, other than that for which a claim has been approved under Workmen’s Compensation Assistance (WCA); and/or failure to do so would lead to a staff member experiencing extraordinary financial hardship.       4.7. Return to work and light duty    4.7.1. There shall be reasonable accommodation for a staff member affected by an injury or illness-related condition following a period of sick leave. Partial incapacity is normally a temporary condition and is managed accordingly (see Section 4.1 for a definition of incapacity).   4.7.2. If light duty has been requested, it must be supported with a certificate from a registered medical practitioner.   4.7.3. Light duty, if operationally possible, will be determined by the line manager and Human Resources in consultation with the medical practitioner.   4.7.4. Where it is not possible to accommodate light duty, and full, long-term or permanent incapacity is determined, the staff member may be able to access the Income Continuation and Rehabilitation benefit. See: Disability through ill health.      Parental leave (incorporates both previous categories of maternity and paternity leave)   5.1. Guiding principles    5.1.1. UCT's parental leave policy is structured to be as inclusive of as many family arrangements as possible.   5.1.2. Where both parents are UCT staff, they are given the flexibility to decide how the parental leave entitlement will be shared between them, see Section 5.2.6.     5.2. Entitlement    5.2.1. A permanent or T2 staff member is entitled to four months' full pay parental leave if he or she is giving birth and keeping the child, or is the primary adoptive parent (formerly maternity leave).   5.2.2. Alternatively, a permanent or T2 staff member is entitled to five days full pay parenting partner leave if he or she is the legal guardian in either a case of adoption or birth (formerly paternity leave).   5.2.3. A birth mother or primary adoptive parent on a T1 contract is entitled to four months unpaid parental leave.   5.2.4. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff are not entitled to paid or unpaid parental leave. If the pregnancy and birth fall within the period of the ad hoc contract, the contract staff member and line manager should re-negotiate the contract.   5.2.5. Any additional time off required for medical reasons must meet the requirements for incapacity (see 4.1.1), be supported by a valid medical certificate and be taken as sick leave.   5.2.6. Where both parents are UCT staff members:    they must declare via affidavit that they are taking parental leave for the same child(ren), and must submit their leave applications together;   the leave entitlement (parental or adoption, plus parenting partner leave) may be shared between the two parents, taking into account the legislative requirements in clause 5.3; and   leave periods of a shared leave entitlement may overlap or run concurrently.       5.3. Legislative requirements    5.3.1. A pregnant staff member who is entitled to parental leave as per section 5.2 may commence parental leave:    any time from four weeks before the expected date of birth, unless otherwise agreed between the staff member and her Head of Department;   on a date from which a medical practitioner or midwife certifies that it is necessary for the health of the staff member or her unborn child.     5.3.2. In compliance with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, a staff member may not work for six weeks after the birth of her child, unless a medical practitioner or midwife certifies that she is fit to do so.     5.4. Adoption    5.4.1. Where a staff member gives up her baby for adoption, parental leave will end no later than six weeks after the birth of the child.   5.4.2. Where a permanent or T2 staff member adopts a child (under one year of age), he or she is entitled to four months paid parental leave if the primary adoptive parent. This may be shared, as per Section 5.2.6, if both adoptive parents work at UCT.   5.4.3. Where a permanent or T2 staff member adopts an older child, she or he may apply via their line manager to the Executive Director: Human Resources for parental leave.   5.4.4. Each case is considered on its merits, and the amount of parental leave granted depends on the circumstances of each case (to the maximum of four months paid parental leave if the primary adoptive parent).     5.5. Application    5.5.1. The staff member must notify his or her line manager in writing of the date on which he or she intends to commence parental leave and return to work afterwards, using form HR140.   5.5.2. Such notification must be given four weeks before the staff member intends to commence parental leave, or as soon as possible thereafter.   5.5.3. Supporting documentation may be required either before or after the birth/adoption from the birth parent and/or non-birth parent in the form of a marriage certificate, declaration or affidavit, birth registration papers or adoption papers.     5.6. Miscarriage    5.6.1. A staff member who has a miscarriage during the third trimester of pregnancy or bears a still-born child is entitled to parental leave for six weeks regardless of whether or not she had commenced parental leave at the time. Should the staff member require additional time off work for either medical or compassionate reasons, application can be made for sick leave or family responsibility leave. A certificate from a registered medical practitioner is required.   5.6.2. Should the miscarriage occur prior to the third trimester, sick leave must be used. See: Sick leave.     5.7. Additional leave    5.7.1. Where requested, additional leave must be granted immediately following a period of parental leave as follows:    a birth mother or primary adoptive parent will be granted unpaid leave or annual leave, or a combination of annual and unpaid leave until the child is six months old. See: Unpaid leave.   a parenting partner will be granted an additional five working days of leave, either as part of his or her annual leave or as unpaid leave.     5.7.2. Additional unpaid leave for an adoption would be part of the negotiated leave amount as per 5.4.4.     5.8. Flexible working hours    5.8.1. Parents are entitled to request flexible working hours for a period of up to six months after returning to work. While this may not be possible in all cases, the request will receive due consideration and will not be unreasonably withheld.   5.8.2. Time worked in a flexible capacity may not be less than twenty hours per week.   5.8.3. Payment will be pro-rated on the basis of hours worked in the month. A new COE (Cost of Employment) schedule must be signed, indicating how the staff member wishes to structure his or her COE.     5.9. Health, safety and welfare of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers    5.9.1. Time off work is granted for pregnant staff members to visit routine antenatal clinics once a month during the term of pregnancy, subject to:    only the necessary time being taken and return to work after the appointment if this is before the end of the working day;   submission of a medical certificate confirming pregnancy;   authorisation for such leave of absence being obtained 24 hours in advance (where possible); and   proof of attendance being subsequently furnished by the staff member.     5.9.2. A pregnant staff member, or one who is nursing a child, will not be engaged in work that would be hazardous to her health or the health of the child. During the staff member's pregnancy, and for up to six months after the birth of the child, UCT will provide suitable, alternative employment on terms and conditions that are no less favourable than her ordinary terms and conditions of employment, provided that it is practicable to do so.   5.9.3. There shall be reasonable accommodation for breastfeeding mothers with regard to work schedules and facilities for a period of at least 12 months from the date of birth.     5.10. Return to work    5.10.1. On his or her return to work, the staff member's COE will be at least at the same level as it had been when he or she went on parental leave.   5.10.2. If the COE of other staff in his or her department has been reviewed during the period of parental leave, the Head of Department will review and, if appropriate, adjust the staff member’s COE when he or she returns to work.      Family responsibility leave   6.1. Eligibility    6.1.1. Permanent and T2 staff, employed for more than 4 days per week, are entitled to 5 days family responsibility leave per year from the anniversary date of the current employment contract.   6.1.2. Staff on T1 contracts are entitled to 3 days family responsibility leave per year, as provided for in section 27 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997.   6.1.3. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff are not entitled to family responsibility leave.   6.1.4. Family responsibility leave expires each year on the anniversary date.     6.2. Definition    6.2.1. Family responsibility leave may be granted where:    an immediate family member is ill and in need of medical attention from a registered medical practitioner, and where the staff member is required to take care of the ill person; or   upon the death of an immediate family member.     6.2.2. In the case of 6.2.1 above immediate family members include spouse, life partner, parent, adoptive parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, child, adoptive child, grandchild and sibling.   6.2.3. The decision to grant leave rests with the Head of Department provided that the staff member has family responsibility leave due to him or her and operational requirements allow for it.     6.3. Application for family responsibility leave    6.3.1. Application for family responsibility leave must be made in advance if possible, using form HR140. The leave can be taken from the total allocation as a block of consecutive days or in any other combination.   6.3.2. A staff member who is absent from work owing to a family responsibility must immediately inform his or her Head of Department or line manager of the reason for the absence.   6.3.3. Family responsibility leave in the case of illness is granted subject to the provision of a medical certificate for days 3, 4 or 5 of the entitlement (for T1 staff a medical certificate is required for day 3 of the entitlement), which explains the use of this leave to look after an ill immediate family member. A medical certificate is not required for days 1 and 2 of the entitlement.   6.3.4. Family responsibility leave in the case of death, is granted subject to the staff member providing a death certificate for any day of the entitlement.     6.4. Additional days    6.4.1. A staff member needing to look after a seriously ill immediate family member beyond the allotted days, may apply to take annual leave or, if necessary, unpaid leave.      Special Leave   7.1. Eligibility    7.1.1. Permanent PASS and academic staff, and staff on T2 contracts, are eligible for special leave.   7.1.2. Staff on T1 contracts are eligible for special leave with rights and pay on UCT business, but not for any other type of special leave.   7.1.3. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff, are not eligible for special leave.     7.2. Absences on University business (special leave with rights and pay)    7.2.1. Special leave with rights and pay is granted when a staff member is to be away from UCT on University business, for example when attending a conference or undertaking field work for periods of up to 15 working days. For academic staff, periods in excess of 15 working days are normally taken as contact leave. In rare cases, motivations for special leave with pay for continuous periods in excess of 15 working days will require the approval of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor responsible for academic staff or the Executive Director: Human Resources for PASS staff.   7.2.2. The staff member continues to be paid his or her normal salary and to enjoy his or her normal staff benefits. Leave accrues during special leave with pay.     7.3. Absences when summonsed for a court appearance (special leave with rights and pay)    7.3.1. Special leave may be applied for where a staff member has been subpoenaed to appear in court as a witness.

Staff wishing to be absent from the University in order to participate in sport, whether at international or other level, must use their annual leave in the first instance and thereafter apply for special leave. All categories of sport are considered and each application is considered on its merits.     7.5. Absences on professional business (special leave without pay but with rights)    7.5.1. Special leave without pay but with rights is granted when a staff member is away from UCT on business that is not UCT business but is related to his or her discipline or profession. For example this would be granted to a staff member taking up a short term appointment at another university, after which he or she would return to normal duties at UCT.   7.5.2. The staff member is not paid during this period.   7.5.3. Membership of the UCT Retirement Fund or the Associated Institutions Pension Fund continues for this period. The University meets only part of its normal contribution (up to 22.5% of the staff member’s retirement-funding income), but the staff member must make prior arrangements to meet any further contributions to the fund that may be required.   7.5.4. Group Life cover continues for this period, as part of the 22.5% mentioned above. Where the staff member has optional multiple cover, he or she must make prior arrangements to meet these contributions.   7.5.5. The staff member is required to retain medical aid cover during this period and must make prior arrangements to meet the full cost of this cover.   7.5.6. No leave of any kind accrues during this period.     7.6. Absences on personal business (special leave without pay and without rights)    7.6.1. Special leave without pay and without rights is granted when a staff member is away from UCT on personal business.   7.6.2. The staff member is not paid during this period.   7.6.3. Members of the UCTRF during the absence:    must contribute risk and admin cost (Payroll Office will advise the percentage during consultation) or;   may contribute 22.5% (risk cover and retirement funding).     7.6.4. While on leave without pay and without rights, a staff member will have to make arrangements to meet the cost of his/her choice above.   7.6.5. Where the period of leave is 120 days or less, members of the Associated Institutions Pension Fund must retain their membership and the University will pay its contributions. Members of the UCT Retirement Fund may elect to make retirement funding contributions during such periods entirely at their own cost. However staff are obliged, whatever they elect to do, to pay the full cost of risk and death benefits.   7.6.6. Group Life cover continues for the period, but entirely at the cost of the staff member. In the case of UCTRF members the Group Life cost is part of the full cost of risk and death benefits.   7.6.7. The staff member is required to retain medical aid cover and must make prior arrangements to meet the full cost of this cover.   7.6.8. No leave of any kind accrues during this period.      Payment and transfer of leave   8.1. Pay out on termination    8.1.1. Staff on academic conditions of service may claim leave pay at completion of contract, resignation, dismissal, retrenchment or retirement if they were unable to take it during the year. This must be supported in writing by the HOD and Dean.   8.1.2. Any outstanding leave for permanent and T2 PASS staff is paid out on completion of contract, resignation, dismissal, retrenchment or retirement.   8.1.3. Untaken leave for T1 contract staff is only paid out at end of contract if the contractor was unable to take leave during the contract. This must be supported in writing by the HOD or line manager.   8.1.4. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff may only claim leave pay at end of contract if they were unable to take or claim leave during the contract. This must be supported in writing by the HOD or line manager and is subject to 3.6.1., which states that they must have worked more than 24 hours in those months for which leave is claimed.   8.1.5. A gratuity in respect of the balance of unutilised study and research leave standing to the credit of the staff member may be paid on death or retirement, subject to approval of the Dean, and is calculated on the basis of a formula. See Study and Research Leave Policy.   8.1.6. Where possible, leave is paid out two weeks after the last day of service.   8.1.7. All liabilities due by the staff member to the University will be recovered from this leave pay.     8.2. Changes of appointment    8.2.1. When a T1 staff member moves from one department to another, leave is paid out. The new department or fund holder cannot take responsibility for taking of or payout of previous leave.   8.2.2. When a permanent staff member moves to another department, leave must be transferred.   8.2.3. When contract staff are reappointed in the same department, leave is transferred.      Unpaid leave   9.1. Unpaid leave is commonly used when annual leave has run out and will come into effect automatically when other leave quotas have been depleted.   9.2. Staff may use, or apply for, up to 15 days unpaid leave when necessary. After 15 days unpaid leave, special leave without pay comes into effect.   9.3. Unpaid leave is allowed following a period of parental leave until the child is 6 months old, see clause 5.7.   9.4. An application for unpaid leave is made using form HR140, and is granted at the discretion of the line manager.   9.5. COE for unpaid leave is zero but benefits do continue. The cost of benefits is recovered from any remaining salary. It is advised that staff in this situation speak to their HR Practitioner to understand the financial implications.   9.6. Annual leave does not accrue during a period of unpaid leave.    Absence without leave (AWOL)   10.1. Any absence without prior leave, without the staff member informing his or her line manager within a reasonable period, or without a medical certificate, will be deemed as unauthorised absence.   10.2. Absence without leave (AWOL) must be reported using form HR140, and should be reported by the line manager after two days if the staff member is not present.   10.3. The University will withhold pay for a staff member who is absent without leave.   10.4. Once reported, unauthorised absence could lead to disciplinary action and may result in dismissal.

"Eligibility for Ad Hominem promotion | Review of ad hominem promotions process | Ad Hominem promotions: Faculty procedures  Eligibility for Ad Hominem promotion  1. Eligibility for Ad Hominem promotion   1.1. If a staff member is on university conditions of service (PE), he/she must have been confirmed in his/her appointment before applying for promotion. Should a staff member on probation be clearly performing very well, at any point, a Head of Department may make a case for early confirmation of appointment. This must have the support of the Dean and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor responsible for academic matters. The proposal must be based on achievements of SASP (Standard Academic Salary Package) criteria obtained after the appointment of the staff member. 1.2. Joint staff on Western Cape Government conditions of service If a person is on the conditions of service of a health authority, on a joint Western Cape Government establishment (in addition to 1.1.), he/she must:   be on the permanent staff if a South African citizen be held against a permanent post if not a South African citizen.     2. Committee structures and guidelines   2.1. Faculty Promotion and Remuneration Committee Each faculty appoints a committee to consider ad hominem promotion and above SASP awards. Membership: Dean, DVC, two outside Deans, and other members as determined by the faculty board.  The committee   makes recommendations on ad hominem promotions to the Vice-Chancellor makes recommendations on above SASP to the DVC: academic matters for approval by the meeting of the Deans.   The committee may lay down the procedures to be followed within the faculty. Faculty specific criteria for ad hominem promotion are applied.  The structure, function and powers of this committee and any sub-committee must be approved by the faculty board. No applications may be suppressed by sub-committees (i.e. the final committee must consider all applications).  Recommendation for ad hominem promotions requires a two thirds majority vote. Should two of the Deputy Vice-Chancellors and the two cognate Deans oppose a recommendation, the recommendation must be referred to the committee of the Deans for a final decision, even if it receives two-thirds support from the faculty committee as a whole.  Recommendations to the Vice-Chancellor on ad hominem promotions must   contain copies of the candidate's curricula vitae and the names and addresses of the referees consulted, and, in the case of a Professor contain the committee's assessment that it is satisfied as to the international standing of the candidate's scholarship.   Faculty promotion and remuneration committees must arrange for feedback to be given to successful and unsuccessful candidates, and to the relevant HODs. An unsuccessful candidate should be informed as to why his/her application was not successful.  2.2. Committee of the Deans Membership: the DVC responsible for academic matters (Chair) and the Deans.  The purpose of this committee is to ensure co-ordination and consistency between faculty criteria and procedures and to review the ad hominem promotions process.  The committee further decides on recommendations where two out of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and the two cognate Deans oppose a recommendation at faculty level.

"Introduction | Informal disciplinary action | Initiating formal disciplinary action | Formal disciplinary action: Minor misconduct | Formal disciplinary action: Serious misconduct | Appendix A | Appendix B   Introduction   A staff member is required to maintain good conduct. Some requirements of good conduct are listed in Appendix A. A staff member who fails to maintain good conduct is liable to disciplinary action. Some notes and guidelines are given in Appendix B. The objective of discipline and the disciplinary procedure is to secure good conduct. The disciplinary procedure is designed:  to correct misconduct and to provide a sanction for misconduct (the objective of sanction is to prevent further misconduct and/or correct misconduct); or to provide for dismissal where the employment relationship has broken down.   Questions of discipline affecting members of academic staff should be approached in a collegial manner. As far as reasonably possible, the privacy of the individual will be observed. The Head of Department (HOD) and Dean will, however, be informed of the intention to take any proceedings, and the outcome of the proceedings. Further publication will be at the discretion of the Vice Chancellor. It is part of the role of the HOD to deal with misconduct in his/her Department. In fulfilling this role, he/she shall refer the matter to one of the 3 possible levels (described in g) at which disciplinary action may be taken, the appropriate level being determined by the severity of the alleged misconduct. These procedures shall provide for 3 possible levels at which disciplinary action may be taken.  The Head of Department: for informal action in isolated instances of minor misconduct (see paragraph 2 below) The Selected Faculty Authority (SFA): for formal disciplinary action in instances of minor misconduct. (Each Faculty has the flexibility to site this responsibility in the Head of Department, in the Head of cognate Department, in a standing tribunal for the Faculty of one or more members of staff, or in the Dean of the Faculty, the last possibility being appropriate in some small faculties.) A Committee of Inquiry: for formal disciplinary action in instances of serious misconduct.   Through these procedures, wherever the HOD is referred to, read Dean if the staff member charged with alleged misconduct is a HOD, and read Deputy Vice Chancellor if the staff member is a Dean. The existence of these procedures does not in any way limit the right of the University to initiate criminal or civil action against a member of staff.   Informal disciplinary action  The HOD should address any isolated case of minor misconduct by counselling the staff member or issuing an oral warning. The HOD shall keep a record of all such action, and shall give the member of staff a copy of any record; the staff member and the HOD shall sign both copies of this record. Because this action would be informal, any such record will not form part of his/her employment record, and will not be kept on the staff member's personal file (that is, the formal staff record kept on each staff member by the Executive Director, Human Resources in the Human Resources Department).  Such records will, however, be admissible in subsequent formal proceedings.    Initiating formal disciplinary action  Any allegation of misconduct which involves a member of the academic staff is to be reported to the staff member's HOD or the Vice Chancellor. If the HOD receives the allegation and considers that it is an allegation of minor misconduct, the HOD shall deal with the matter as per paragraph 2, or refer the matter for formal disciplinary action to the authority selected by his/her faculty for addressing minor misconduct; if he/she considers that the allegation is one of serious misconduct, he/she shall refer the allegation to the Vice Chancellor. If the Vice Chancellor receives the allegation and considers that it is an allegation of minor misconduct he/she shall refer it to the HOD or the Selected Faculty Authority; if he/she considers that the allegation is one of serious misconduct, he/she shall refer the matter for investigation to a Preliminary Investigating Committee and shall inform the staff member(s) concerned of both the allegation and his/her decision.    Formal disciplinary action: Minor misconduct The Selected Faculty Authority (HOD, cognate HOD, standing tribunal or Dean) shall have formal disciplinary powers over academic staff for minor misconduct. The procedure is intended to be simple and fair. Some basic requirements of procedural fairness are set out below.   Investigation  Formal action shall not be taken without prima facie evidence of misconduct. An investigation may be necessary to establish such evidence.  The Head of Department may handle or arrange any necessary investigation within the department for minor misconduct, or ask the administration to assist with this investigation. If prima facie evidence of misconduct exists, a disciplinary inquiry is required.  The formal disciplinary inquiry: Minor misconduct  Preliminaries  Prior to a formal disciplinary inquiry by the SFA, the staff member shall be notified in advance, in writing, of the time and place of the hearing, and the substance of the allegation(s) against him/her. Such notice period shall be sufficient to enable the staff member to prepare his/her case. The staff member shall be informed that he/she has the right to be assisted or represented at the inquiry by a member of staff. If the representative of the staff member's choice is not available, and if sufficient notice of the inquiry has been given, the staff member may choose another representative. A staff member who decides not to be represented, may at any stage change such a decision provided that this shall not unduly delay the process of the inquiry.   The inquiry: The role of the SFA The SFA shall approach the inquiry with an open and unbiased mind. Any SFA or member of an SFA who believes that he/she will be unable to approach the inquiry with an open and unbiased mind, shall recuse himself/herself.  The member of staff (against whom the allegation has been made) may challenge the impartiality of any member(s) of the SFA. If, in the opinion of the SFA, good cause is shown why the SFA, or any member(s) of it, should recuse herself/himself/themselves, he/she/they shall do so.  Where a member of the SFA recuses himself/herself, the Dean shall appoint an alternate. If the Dean is the only member of the SFA, the Vice Chancellor shall appoint an alternate.  The inquiry: The process  The inquiry shall be divided into two parts:  Consideration of the evidence and whether the member of staff is guilty of misconduct as charged; and Where a finding of guilty is reached, the inquiry shall proceed to  Consideration of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the sanction.   The inquiry may consist only of the SFA and the staff member. If the staff member elects to bring a representative, the SFA may decide to have another senior staff member or a member of the Human Resources Department present, the role of this second person being limited to advice (e.g. procedural advice). The Chair of the SFA shall keep a brief written record, noting the charges, the salient facts put before it, the finding, evidence in mitigation or aggravation, and the sentence. The name of the staff member's representative shall be recorded in the Inquiry Report. If a staff member does not wish to be represented, this shall be recorded in the Inquiry Report. The staff member and his/her representative may be present throughout the hearing. The staff member and his/her representative may question the witnesses, call other witnesses, question any documentary evidence, and submit documentary evidence. Where practicable, the evidence against the staff member shall be presented by persons who have first hand knowledge of the facts to which they testify. Upon request and if the circumstances warrant this, the SFA may give a witness permission to be accompanied by a support person (e.g. in a harassment case). The failure of the staff member without valid and sufficient reason to be present at the hearing, either personally or through a representative, shall not invalidate the proceedings. The hearing may then take place in the absence of the staff member and the record will reflect this. In considering the case, the SFA shall hear and take account of all relevant evidence and argument and make a finding, on a balance of probabilities, on the allegation against the member of staff. If the evidence does not support the allegation, the inquiry shall be closed and the staff member acquitted of the allegation. Where a finding of guilty is reached, the staff member shall be informed and the inquiry shall proceed to the stage of determining the sanction. The staff member and his/her representative shall be given the opportunity to lead evidence in mitigation. Evidence of aggravating circumstances may also be led at this stage. The SFA shall decide on the appropriate sanction at the end of the inquiry, and shall inform the staff member and his/her representative of this in writing as soon as possible. The SFA shall make a report of the salient points of the inquiry. A copy of the report shall be given to the staff member or his/her representative.   Possible Sanction  The SFA shall decide on the sanction. The sanction imposed depends on:  the seriousness of the misconduct; and mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances.   The sanction imposed may be one of the following:  reprimand/oral warning; written warning; or final written warning.   Note: As dismissal is not within the jurisdiction of the SFA, if it becomes apparent in the course of the inquiry that the misconduct is serious, the SFA shall suspend the inquiry and refer the matter to the VC.    Appeal against a decision of a SFA  A staff member has the right, either personally or through his/her representative, to appeal against any formal disciplinary finding or sanction. If a Head of Department or Faculty tribunal imposed the sanction the staff member may appeal to the Dean. If a Dean imposed the sanction the staff member may appeal to the Vice-Chancellor who shall in turn nominate a Deputy Vice-Chancellor to hear the appeal.  An appeal must be lodged in writing within seven (7) days of the disciplinary action being notified to the staff member in writing. The bases for appealing against the finding and/or sanction must be stated in the notice of appeal. No person involved in the original inquiry or investigation shall hear the appeal. Unless substantial injustice would otherwise result, an appeal shall be heard on the record and any additional argument which either party may choose to present. The person or the committee hearing the appeal shall consider both procedural and substantive questions, and shall make a finding on  the finding and the sanction, where the appeal is against both, or sanction only, where the appeal is against sanction only.         Formal disciplinary action: Serious misconduct  The investigation: Preliminary Investigating Committee (PIC) Formal action must not be taken without prima facie evidence of misconduct. Where the Vice Chancellor believes that there is an allegation of serious misconduct which requires formal investigation he/she must appoint a Preliminary Investigating Committee (PIC) to consider the allegation. The function of a PIC is to determine whether there is prima facie evidence for a charge, and if there is, to formulate a charge. The PIC will not necessarily hear, or assess, the evidence. Having established a charge, the PIC or its nominee may negotiate a settlement of the matter with the staff member concerned if the staff member initiates such a process.    Composition of the PIC The PIC consists of:   a Deputy Vice-Chancellor appointed by the Vice Chancellor (Chair); the Head of Department or Dean or Head of a cognate department chosen by the Vice Chancellor; a member of the academic staff who has been confirmed in his/her appointment, with a qualification in law, chosen by the Vice Chancellor; and a person chosen by the staff member(s) concerned from the available members of the Senate panel of twenty. Note: A panel of twenty academic staff must be selected biennially by Senate to serve on PICs and COIs. One third of the panel must be of professorial rank, and two thirds of the panel must be below that rank. The composition of the panel should reflect racial and gender diversity.    Quorum The quorum for a PIC is three members.  The process of the PIC  The members of the PIC shall approach the inquiry with open and unbiased minds. A member of a PIC who believes that he/she will be unable to approach the inquiry with an open and unbiased mind shall recuse himself/herself. The member of staff against whom the allegation has been made may challenge the impartiality of any member of the PIC. If, in the opinion of the Chair of the PIC, good cause is shown why any member, or members, of the PIC, including the Chair, should recuse himself/herself/themselves, the Chair shall rule that he/she/they shall recuse himself/herself/themselves.  The Vice Chancellor shall replace any member who recuses himself or herself at the start of proceedings.  The Vice Chancellor may replace a member who recuses himself or herself during the inquiry, but shall not be obliged to do so provided a quorum remains. Where a member is replaced during the inquiry the proceedings shall start afresh.  The Vice Chancellor may appoint a person to present the case before the PIC. The Executive Director, Human Resources may appoint a person to service the PIC. The Chair of the PIC shall keep or be responsible for ensuring that a brief written record is kept. A member of staff may be represented at the PIC by another member of staff. The staff member and his/her representative may be present throughout the hearing. The staff member and his/her representative may question the witnesses, call other witnesses, question any documentary evidence, and submit documentary evidence. Where practicable, the evidence against the staff member shall be presented by persons who have first hand knowledge of the facts to which they testify. Upon request, and if the circumstances warrant this, the Chair of the PIC may give a witness permission to be accompanied by a support person (e.g. in a harassment case). The failure of the staff member without valid and sufficient reason to be present at the PIC, either personally or through a representative, shall not invalidate the proceedings. The preliminary investigation may then take place in the absence of the staff member and the record will reflect this.   Time limits A PIC shall complete its enquiry and render its decision within one month of the date on which the Vice Chancellor appointed it, provided that the Vice Chancellor may extend this by up to one month where the PIC, with the agreement of the staff member, asks for an extension.  Action The Preliminary Investigating Committee shall:   dismiss the allegation; or refer a case to the Vice Chancellor for consideration by a Committee of Inquiry (see paragraph 5.3), in which instance the PIC will formulate the charge(s); or upon terms agreed to by the PIC and the staff member, terminate the staff member's appointment or take some other agreed action.   Suspension  If the Vice Chancellor has reason to believe that it would be in the interests of the University for the member of staff to be suspended immediately from some or all of his/her duties and not to enter any premises that may be under the control of the University, the Vice Chancellor may, after having referred the allegation against the member of staff to the PIC, suspend him/her from some or all of his/her duties and may order him/her not to enter all or any premises under the control of the University until the PIC dismisses the allegation or determines the matter upon agreed terms, or until the COI makes known its decision or the Vice Chancellor or the Council's standing tribunal lifts the order. A member who is suspended shall at all times be entitled to receive all salary and benefits to which he or she is entitled as a member of staff. A member of staff who is suspended is entitled to a hearing by the Vice Chancellor within 72 hours of the suspension order being made. After hearing the staff member the Vice Chancellor will have the discretion to confirm, vary or withdraw the suspension order.     Committee of Inquiry (COI)  Preliminaries  Prior to a COI, the staff member shall be notified in advance, in writing, of the time and place of the hearing, and the substance of the allegation(s) against him/her. Such notice period shall be sufficient to enable the staff member to prepare his/her case. The staff member shall be informed that he/she has the right to be assisted or represented at the inquiry. Any form of representation is permitted at a COI at the staff member's expense. If the representative of the staff member's choice is not available, and if sufficient notice of the inquiry has been given, the staff member is required to choose another representative. A staff member who decides not to be represented, may at any stage change such a decision provided that this shall not unduly delay the process of the COI.   Composition of the Committee of Inquiry A Committee of Inquiry (COI) has disciplinary powers over academic staff for serious misconduct or where disciplinary action taken at the faculty level has failed to correct misconduct.  The Committee of Inquiry consists of:   the Vice-Chancellor or his/her nominee (the Chair); a member of the academic staff who has been confirmed in his/her appointment, with a qualification in law, chosen by the Vice Chancellor; a person chosen by the Vice Chancellor from the Senate panel of twenty; (Note: A panel of twenty academic staff must be selected biennially by Senate to serve on PICs and COIs. One third of the panel must be of professorial rank, and two thirds of the panel must be below that rank. The composition of the panel should reflect racial and gender diversity.);  and, at the request of the Vice Chancellor and/or the staff member, but appointed by the COI, one person with relevant expertise (eg a medico-legal expert.). The members of the Committee of Inquiry shall approach the inquiry with open and unbiased minds.  No member of the PIC that referred a case to the Vice Chancellor for consideration by a COI should be a member of the COI subequently chosen by the Vice Chancellor.  Any member of the COI who believes that he/she will be unable to approach the inquiry with an open and unbiased mind, shall recuse himself/herself.  The member of staff against whom the allegation has been made may challenge the impartiality of any member(s) of the COI. If, in the opinion of the Chair of the COI, good cause is shown why any member or members of the Committee, including the Chair, should recuse him/herself or themselves, the Chair shall rule that she/he or they shall recuse himself/herself/themselves.  Where a member of a COI recuses himself/herself at the start of proceedings, the Vice Chancellor shall replace the member.  The Vice Chancellor may replace a member who recuses himself or herself during the inquiry, but shall not be obliged to do so provided a quorum remains. Where a member is replaced during the inquiry the proceedings shall start afresh.    Quorum The quorum for a COI is three members.  Committee of Inquiry: The process  The inquiry shall be divided into two parts:  Consideration of the evidence and whether the member of staff is guilty of misconduct as charged; and Where it reaches a finding of guilty, the COI shall thereafter proceed to  Consideration of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the sanction.   The Vice Chancellor may appoint a person to present the case against the member of staff before the Committee of Inquiry. This may be the same person who has presented the case before the PIC. The Executive Director, Human Resources may appoint a person to service the COI. The Chair of the COI is responsible for keeping or ensuring that a record of the salient points is kept. However, if the staff member or any member of the COI wants the proceedings to be audio-taped, steps must be taken to do so. The name of the staff member's representative must be recorded in the Inquiry Report. If a staff member does not wish to be represented, this must be recorded in the Inquiry Report. The staff member and his/her representative may be present throughout the hearing. The staff member and his/her representative may question the witnesses, call other witnesses, question any documentary evidence, and submit documentary evidence. Where practicable, the evidence against the staff member shall be presented by persons who have first hand knowledge of the facts to which they testify. Upon request, and if the circumstances warrant this, the COI may give a witness permission to be accompanied by a support person (e.g. in a harassment case). The failure of the staff member without valid and sufficient reason to be present at the COI, either personally or through a representative, shall not invalidate the proceedings. The COI may then take place in the absence of the staff member and the record will reflect this. In considering the case, the COI shall hear and take account of all relevant evidence and argument and make a finding, on a balance of probabilities, on the allegation against the member of staff. If the evidence does not support the allegation, the inquiry shall be closed and the staff member acquitted of the allegation. Where a finding of guilty is reached, the staff member shall be informed and the inquiry shall proceed to the stage of determining sanction. The staff member and his/her representative shall be given the opportunity to lead evidence in mitigation. Evidence of aggravating circumstances may also be led at this stage. The COI shall decide on the appropriate sanction at the end of the inquiry, and must inform the staff member and his/her representative of this in writing as soon as possible. The Chair of the COI shall make a report of the proceedings. A copy of the report and recording/s (if the inquiry was recorded and if so requested) shall be given to the staff member or his/her representative. Only if a transcript has been made of any portions of the recording/s shall this be given to the member of staff; the member of staff will have no right to require a transcript of any recording or recordings which has or have not been transcribed.   Possible sanctions:  The Committee of Inquiry shall decide on the sanction. The sanction imposed depends on:  the seriousness of the misconduct; and mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances.   Formal disciplinary action may include one of the following:  reprimand/oral warning; written warning; final written warning; dismissal with notice; or summary dismissal.   If the misconduct warrants dismissal and the COI decides upon dismissal but considers an alternative to dismissal acceptable, the COI may offer an alternative. If the offer is accepted by the staff member it shall apply. If the alternative is refused by the staff member, the dismissal shall stand. (Examples of such alternatives are: suspension without pay, demotion, transfer or any combination of these.)     Note: Misconduct is not the same as poor performance. For example, poor teaching and poor research will usually be instances of poor performance, and need to be addressed through different procedures. A separate procedure for addressing poor performance will be developed.       Appendix A  A staff member is required to maintain good conduct. Some requirements of good conduct are that he or she must:   discharge departmental duties diligently; abide by University rules; conduct himself/herself with honesty and integrity; not contravene the University's policies on sexual and/or racial harassment; not bring to, or house or use on University property any firearm, dangerous weapon or mock weapon (without prior written permission from the Executive Director, Human Resources); and not knowingly disclose confidential information.*   * Note on Confidential Information:  In general, university business is open. Privacy and confidence are, however, sometimes necessary and in such cases must be observed. The following are categories of business and information that are confidential and must be restricted on a need-to-know basis. This list is not exhaustive.   Examination question papers; Confidential referees reports; Business information where the University's financial interests depend upon this e.g. proposed property acquisition, or negotiating positions; Research results where a patent application has been made, or is to be made; Donor information, when a donor requires anonymity; or Private information on individuals (e.g. staff medical reports), unless the individual has placed this in the public domain.    Appendix B  Some explanatory notes on misconduct   The appropriate procedure  Minor misconduct  Informal action (HOD) Formal action (Selected Faculty Authority)   Serious misconduct  Formal action (PCI and COI)     Minor misconduct may become serious misconduct if repeated, especially if corrective action fails (i.e. the staff member has already been warned, but he/she repeats the misconduct.) Serious misconduct may result in a serious sanction such as dismissal even if there are no prior warnings. A decision on the seriousness of any particular misconduct requires the exercise of judgement. The action cannot be isolated from the context and therefore one cannot specify in a procedure like this what sanction is appropriate for what misconduct. A Head of Department who is concerned about whether an allegation of misconduct should be considered ""minor"" or ""serious"" may contact his or her Dean, other Heads of Department or the Employee Relations section of the Human Resources Department for advice and/or information on UCT precedent.

"General | Procedure for an individual grievance | Procedure for a group grievance | Attendance at grievance hearings (group and individual) | Relation between the grievance and disciplinary procedures  Definitions   Unless stated otherwise ""staff member"" in this procedure refers to an employee on academic staff conditions of service. ""Day"", for the purpose of determining time periods in this procedure, means any day except Saturday, Sundays, statutory public holidays and University holidays. ""Management"" means the relevant HOD, Dean, Vice-Chancellor or nominee with whom the grievance is lodged.    General   A grievance is any dissatisfaction and/or feeling of injustice in connection with a staff member's work and/or employment situation (other than conditions of service and salary range, and other than arising from disciplinary action) which is brought to the attention of the relevant authorities. No staff member may be victimised as a result of his/her raising a grievance. The intention of the policy is that grievances be resolved at the earliest stage possible and as quickly as possible. The time periods specified below are maximum time periods, to be utilised to the full only where the complexity of the grievance requires the full use thereof. Where it is impracticable to address a grievance within the time limit set out in the procedure, an extension can be agreed between the staff member lodging the grievance and the chair of the hearing. Such an extension must be recorded in writing and signed by both parties. All time periods refer to full working days. If the staff member who initiates this grievance procedure fails to pursue the complaint through the channels provided for, it must be assumed either that he/she abides by the resolution reached by that stage, or that the complaint had no substance. A member of staff with a grievance may be assisted throughout the procedure by either a representative from the Academics' Union or any other UCT staff member acting as his/her representative. Where a staff member's (or group of staff members') grievance arises from allegations of racism, racial discrimination or racial harassment, he/she/they must follow the procedure outlined in the University policy on racism and racial harassment. Where a grievance arises out of allegations of sexual harassment, the staff member/s must follow the procedure outlined in the policy and procedure on sexual harassment. Any decisions made must be accompanied by relevant reasons. From stage two in this procedure the University's representative or the member of staff may request that the grievance be referred to the University's Mediation Policy. The mediation is voluntary and will take place only if both parties agree. If there is agreement to mediation, the grievance procedure will be put on hold whilst the mediation takes place. In the event that no mutually acceptable solution is reached through the mediation process, the procedure will be reconvened from where it was put on hold. For full details, see the University's Mediation Policy.   Procedure for an individual grievance  Stage one (Head of Department) If any member of staff wishes to raise a grievance, he/she must informally approach his/her immediate senior at which point an attempt must be made to resolve the grievance at this level. Should the grievance relate to the actions of the HOD, the staff member must in the normal course of events approach the HOD in an attempt to seek a resolution of the matter. If the staff member so wishes, he/she may obtain the assistance of a representative. Two days will be allowed for this stage.  Stage two (Dean of faculty) If the grievance has not been resolved informally, the staff member may take the grievance further and formalise the process by making written representations to the Dean of the faculty. The Dean is obliged to consider mediation of the grievance in accordance with the University's Mediation Policy. The staff member must send a copy of such a representation to his/her HOD, and a copy to the Employee Relations section of the Human Resources Department, both within three days of the end of stage one. Within two days of receipt of such representations, a meeting of the following people must be convened by the Dean to whom the written representations were sent:   a chairperson (Dean or his/her nominee more senior than the HOD) the staff member lodging the grievance the staff member's representative (if requested by the staff member) the staff member against whom the grievance is lodged the staff member's HOD a representative from the Human Resources Department   From the date of this meeting, up to three days will be allowed for a resolution to be achieved before proceeding to the next stage.  The chairperson's decision signifies the end of stage two. Within a further three days the chairperson must complete his/her report on the grievance hearing proceedings, as well as his/her proposal towards resolving the grievance. A copy of the chairperson's report must be sent to all parties concerned.  Stage three (Vice-Chancellor) In the three days following the end of stage two, should the staff member wish to take the grievance further, he/she must make written representations to this effect to the Vice-Chancellor, sending a copy to the Employee Relations section. The Vice-Chancellor or the Vice-Chancellor's nominee must review the case. If the Vice-Chancellor appoints a nominee, the staff member with the grievance and his/her representative (if applicable) must be advised accordingly. The Vice-Chancellor or his/her representative is obliged to consider mediation of the grievance in accordance with the University's Mediation Policy. If deemed necessary by the Vice-Chancellor (or nominee) in order to establish further facts about the case, a meeting must be convened within five days of receipt of representations pertaining to the grievance. The meeting must consist of:   the chairperson (the Vice-Chancellor or the Vice-Chancellor's nominee) the staff member lodging the grievance the staff member's representative (if requested by the staff member) the chairperson of the stage two hearing, and, if this chairperson requires it, the staff member's HOD a representative from the Human Resources Department any other staff member(s) the chairperson wishes to invite in order to facilitate the resolution of the grievance   From the date of this meeting five days will be allowed for a resolution to be achieved. The chairperson's decision signifies the end of the grievance procedure. Within a further five days the chairperson must complete his/her report on the grievance hearing proceedings and his/her proposal to resolve the grievance. A copy of the chairperson's report must be sent to all parties concerned.    Procedure for a group grievance  Where it is evident that two or more staff members have the same grievance, the staff members may elect to have the grievance dealt with as one. Where practicalities militate against a group grievance being dealt with as a group, the group must elect a spokesperson(s) that will act on behalf of the group. It is assumed that the spokesperson(s) will carry the full mandate of the group they represent and that any decisions they take in respect of the resolution of the grievance are binding on all the individual members of such a group. One of the following procedures may be chosen:  Where it is evident that two or more staff members (i.e. academic staff from the same dept/unit) have the same grievance, it may be addressed via the grievance procedure detailed in section two of this procedure. Alternatively, the procedure detailed below may be followed. Where it is evident that two or more staff members have the same grievance but the staff members concerned do not come from the same dept/unit, the grievance may be taken, as an agenda item, to the working group on academic staff matters. Notwithstanding the procedure in 3c i or 3c ii in the case of a group grievance, a meeting may be convened within three days of the Dean/HOD and the Employee Relations section being sent written representations pertaining to the grievance. This meeting must comprise the elected spokesperson(s) (as defined in 3b) and their representative (if requested by staff members) and management representatives.     Attendance at grievance hearings (group and individual) A grievance will often involve a complaint by one person against another. Handling the relationship between complainant and the person complained against requires care. This is especially so when these two people are in a close working relationship (e.g. as members of a team) or in a line relationship. The person complained against should not be required to attend a grievance hearing with all parties present against his/her will. If necessary, the chairperson will have to hear the complainant and the person complained against separately. Where possible this should be avoided. In cases of close working relationships or line relationships, a meeting with both parties present (if necessary a second round, after individual meetings) may be insisted upon by the chairperson as part of what he/she sees as necessary for facilitating a resolution of the grievance.  Relation between the grievance and disciplinary procedures  Grievances are often the result of a misunderstanding between two or more parties and misconduct is not necessarily involved. Should, however, a grievance be brought to the attention of management and, after investigation, management is satisfied that there is evidence of misconduct on the part of the staff member who is the subject of the grievance, the matter must be handled in terms of the disciplinary procedure. The staff member who lodged the grievance may be asked to be a witness at a disciplinary enquiry. The decision to invoke the disciplinary procedure will normally mark the end of the grievance procedure. If on application either by the grievant or the person grieved against, the relevant Dean or the Vice-Chancellor is satisfied that the grievance procedure should continue simultaneously or be revived at the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings, it may be so ordered.

"Introduction | Proposal to disestablish an occupied post | The consultation process on the proposal to disestablish a post(s) | Process to be followed once the decision to disestablish an occupied post or posts is taken | Severance pay in the event of retrenchment   Introduction  The processes outlined in this document are designed to deal with the employee relations implications of the disestablishment of occupied posts. For strategic restructuring proposals the relevant university bodies (e.g. strategic planning committee, faculty boards, Senate or Council) must agree that the proposal is worth pursuing before the employee relations implications are considered, and before consultations with the affected or potentially affected staff members need to begin in terms of this procedure.  All academic post vacancies require a reconsideration of operational need before they are filled at any level. A Dean may decide to disestablish an unoccupied post, but any proposal to disestablish an occupied post (or posts) could result in the retrenchment of staff. The chairperson of the Employee Relations Management Committee (ERMC) has the final authority regarding the retrenchment of staff. The process detailed below must be followed (there are two separate processes related to two separate decisions).  The first decision concerns the post or posts, thus if the first decision is to disestablish an occupied post or posts, the second decision concerns what happens to the staff member(s) in the post(s).  The Labour Relations Act, 1995, recognises that an employer may need to terminate contracts of employment because of operational requirements. The act defines ""operational requirements"" as requirements based on ""the economic, technological, structural or similar needs of an employer."" The act also requires that a fair procedure be followed and sets out certain requirements. The procedure detailed below has been set up according to the requirements of the act and by UCT's decision-making structures, authorities, customs and policies.  Proposal to disestablish an occupied post  The origin of the proposal to disestablish an occupied post must be the Dean or an officer designated by the Vice Chancellor. The relevant university bodies (e.g. strategic planning committee, faculty boards, Senate or Council) must agree that the proposal is worth pursuing before the employee relations implications are considered, and before consultations with staff members need to begin in terms of this procedure. The proposal must include  the full rationale for the proposed disestablishment, including the academic consequences. the alternatives considered and reasons for their rejection. an endorsement from the relevant UCT committees indicating that the proposal is worth pursuing.   The Chair of the ERMC shall then consider the proposal and decide on one of the following courses of action:  Refer the proposal back for further motivation and/or for consideration by another university body or other university bodies. In some cases, should the ER implications be considered such that the chair of the ERMC believes the proposal should not be pursued, the Chair of the ERMC will refer his/her concerns to the originator of the proposal. Where agreement cannot be reached, the Vice Chancellor will decide whether or not to proceed to the next stage of consulting staff (i.e. paragraph 2c iii). The relevant HOD and/or Dean, together with a member of the Human Resources Department, will be asked to start the consultation process.     The consultation process on the proposal to disestablish a post(s)  The HOD and/or Dean and a staff member of the HR department shall meet and brief the affected staff and his/her/their representative(s) on the proposal, including reasons for the proposed change. They shall give the affected staff up to four weeks to make representations on the proposal. Should some of the affected staff be on approved period of absence, the consultation should be organised so that it does not prejudice them e.g. communication via letter if someone is on overseas sabbatical. The staff concerned have the right to be assisted by a representative of their choice at all consultations outlined in this procedure, as long as the representative(s) are members of UCT staff. A member of the Academics' Union executive may be included in the above meeting if the staff member is a member of the Academics' Union, and if the staff member agrees. Otherwise the Academics' Union will be sent a written proposal and a member of the HR department will consult with the union. The union will be invited to make representations on the proposal within four weeks. The Dean and HOD shall consider all such representations, and the Dean may amend or withdrawn the original proposal. The Dean shall inform the affected staff and the Academics' Union, in writing, of their final proposal, giving reasons for rejecting or accepting representations made. This communication will take place at least two weeks before the Chair of the ERMC considers the proposal. (Note: for major restructuring exercises a substantially revised proposal would have to be re-submitted to the standard University authorities again.)  The affected staff and/or his/her/their representative(s) and/or the Academics' Union shall have the right to make written representations to the Chair of the ERMC within the time frame referred to in 3d. The Chair of the ERMC shall consider the proposal (i.e. either the original or revised proposal) and any staff and Academics' Union representations before making a decision. If he/she approves the proposal to disestablish an occupied post, the following process shall be set in motion.   Process to be followed once the decision to disestablish an occupied post or posts is taken Where a selection of staff is required, the process outlined in 4a must be followed. Where no such selection is necessary the process detailed in 4b may be followed directly.   Process when staff must be selected.  This process must be followed when the decision to disestablish one or more posts is not linked to specific staff, but where such a selection is made from a pool of possible staff . The process involves consultations with staff, their representatives and the Academics' Union about the selection of the individuals who will be retrenched should alternatives to retrenchment not be found. The process must include the following steps:   The Dean and/or HOD (assisted by an HR department staff member) shall notify, in writing, the pool of possible staff and the Academics' Union that a certain number of posts are to be disestablished. Criteria for selecting staff for retrenchment must be substantially fair and reasonable and may include operational needs relevant experience qualifications skills and training length of service ( i.e. the ""last in, first out"" policy) performance  Criteria may take into account UCT's employment equity plan.  The Dean and/or HOD assisted by an HR department staff member will consult with the group on which criteria they believe should be applied. The agreed criteria (which may not necessarily be drawn from those listed above) will then be used to select the affected staff. The Dean and/or HOD assisted by an HR department staff member will propose staff based on the above criteria. The individuals and their representatives, as well as the Academics' Union, shall be given up to three weeks in which to make representations (including representations on the manner in which the criteria have been applied). The Dean shall consider all representations and may amend the original proposal on staff to be selected. The Dean shall inform, in writing, the affected staff, his/her/their representative(s) and the Academics' Union of the outcome of the representations made (giving reasons for rejecting or accepting any such representations) at least one week before the Chair of the ERMC considers the proposal. The affected staff, their representatives and the Academics' Union may make direct representation, in writing to the Chair of the ERMC within one week of being presented with the Dean's recommendation. The Chair of the ERMC shall then decide the matter. The Dean shall notify the individual/s selected, and the process set out in paragraph 4b shall then be followed.   Process when no selection from a group of staff is required or when staff have been selected as per the process set out in 4a above. If the Chair of the ERMC decides to disestablish an occupied post and this post is linked to a specific staff member, the process thereafter requires consultations with the incumbent and his/her representative in order to seek an alternative to retrenchment. If such an alternative is not found the retrenchment needs to be discussed. This process must include the following steps:   The incumbent of the post will be notified, in writing, of the decision of the Chair of the ERMC and given.  notice of the intention that his/her appointment will be terminated (i.e. that he/she will be retrenched) if an alternative is not found. an invitation to make proposals about alternatives to retrenchment, within a three week period. details of the estimated severance pay and estimated retirement benefit that would be paid out in the event of retrenchment.   The Academics' Union will be notified, in writing, of the decision of the Chair of the ERMC, and invited to make representations regarding any feasible alternatives to the retrenchment of the staff member within three weeks. The HOD and/or Dean and an HR department staff member shall consult with the incumbent of the post and his/her representative and shall consider alternatives to retrenchment, such as redeployment; a temporary lay-off (with or without rights) or short-time work at correspondingly reduced salary levels. (Note: redeployment of academic staff will not be a common viable option due to the specialised nature of most academic work.)  Having consulted with the incumbent and his/her representative and having considered any representations, the Dean shall make a recommendation to the Chair of the ERMC. The recommendation will be sent to the incumbent and (if the staff member has no objection) the Academics' Union. The incumbent, his/her representative and the Academics' Union may make direct representations, in writing, to the Chair of the ERMC within one week of the Dean's recommendation being sent to the Chair of the ERMC. If no alternative to retrenchment is found, formal notice will be given of the decision to terminate the appointment. The contractual notice period (normally six months) will apply unless the chair of the ERMC decides, on good reason, to give more notice. The notice to retrench may be withdrawn if an appropriate alternative post is found in the first half of the notice period. After this time, the incumbent will have the option of accepting either an alternative post offered, or the retrenchment package.     Severance pay in the event of retrenchment  Severance pay will be a lump sum payment. Staff will have the following options:  5% x service x remuneration package up to a maximum of one year's remuneration and no gratuity for study and research leave. OR  4% x service x remuneration package up to a maximum of one year's remuneration and a gratuity for Study and Research leave (maximum 4.5 months). OR  one week's remuneration for each year of service (no ceiling).   Definitions   ""Remuneration package"" includes the salary budget, the medical aid budget, the UCTRF budget, HOD allowances, and the cash value of any payment in kind that forms part of the staff member's standard remuneration. It excludes  gratuities. allowances paid for the purposes of enabling an employee to work (e.g. travel allowance). any discretionary payments not directly related to the employee's hours of work or work performance.   ""Years of continuous service"" will be taken as years rounded to one decimal place (i.e. the definition in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act). ""Gratuity for study and research leave"" will be in respect of the balance of unutilised study and research leave standing to the credit of a staff member. It will be calculated on the basis of three-eighths of the staff member's monthly pensionable salary at the date of retrenchment for the period of his/her leave credit, up to a maximum of four and a half months' salary.   In addition, the following will be due:  payments from the relevant pension or retirement fund pro rata service bonus (where applicable) pay in lieu of annual leave owing   Staff are required to work their notice period but will be granted reasonable time off from duty to seek alternative employment. Staff will be given free access to courses offered by UCT's Information and Communication Technology Services Department and the Staff Learning Programme (offered by Human Resources Development), for 12 months from the date of termination of service. Dependants of a retrenched staff member, who were studying at UCT prior to the termination of the staff member's contract, will continue to pay the staff tuition rate for up to three years or until the current course/degree has been completed (whichever is the shorter period). Staff will receive R1000 as a contribution towards costs incurred for financial and other forms of advice and counselling. This may however be utilised at the staff member's discretion.

"Introduction | Negotiation process | The benchmark | The measure of sustainability |The differentials between academic ranks | Review of the policy  1. Introduction  The pay policy seeks to set levels of remuneration at amounts which enable the University of Cape Town (the University) to attract, retain and motivate staff. It has been decided that the best way of achieving this aim is to benchmark salaries at the University relative to those at a selection of comparator universities, namely, those universities which share a similar research-led culture to that at the University. Arguably these universities constitute the University's major competitors for staff and face similar challenges in terms of spending demands and opportunities to earn income. In making this choice of comparator universities the University acknowledges its commitment to offering a quality educational experience to its students and to a flourishing research culture, and thus to maintaining the necessary staffing levels and infrastructural support for each objective.  The benchmark is to be fixed as follows: the Standard Academic Salary Package (SASP)1 at each rank is to be aligned with the 75th percentile of salaries at that rank at the comparator universities. The rationale for choosing this benchmark is that the University recognizes that, as confirmed by a number of objective measures, it has a pre-eminent status amongst the comparator universities (indeed amongst universities nationally) and primarily owes that status to the quality of its academic and research work. It is thus reasonable to assume that members of UCT's academic staff who are meeting the criteria for SASP are performing at least at the level of three quarters of staff in comparator universities and thus, independent of their other earnings in terms of scarcity, merit or excellence awards, should be paid accordingly. Notwithstanding this, movement away from the benchmark may arise as a result of constraints of sustainability and of attempting to match appropriate differentials between salaries at each rank. (This is dealt with in more detail below.)  The method of implementing the benchmark is complex given the nature and availability of data and is detailed in section 3. The broad thrust of the plan is to fix the benchmark using retrospective data of salary levels combined with an agreed method of projection. Recognising that even retrospective data may be misleading about the true level of the benchmark, this document details a set of triggers which will:   suggest a need to treat the data with some caution; and suggest a judgement about the true level of the benchmark.   The effects of variations caused by inaccuracies in the data will be mitigated in the application of the benchmarking process over time.  Implementation of the benchmark is subject to constraints of being financially sustainable. This document attempts to frame a conception of financial sustainability which divorces that notion from the short-term spending priorities of the University; rather whether a particular salary rise is deemed affordable will depend on the fundamental financial health of the University measured by such things as the levels of its free cash reserves. This is dealt with in more detail below.  Finally, it is acknowledged that the salary structure reflects a career path for academics/researchers and thus maintenance of appropriate differentials between ranks also needs to be a goal of the policy. Differentials should be set at levels which, whilst not threatening solidarity within the staff body, should constitute an incentive to earn promotion. Here it is proposed that targeted differentials be fixed as bands and that these be implemented in informing the judgements with regard to salary increases arising out of the benchmarking process.  2. Negotiation process  The salary negotiation process will proceed in the following steps:   Parties (i.e. Union and Management) agree to the sources of the relevant data. The data is used to arrive at a judgement on the levels of the 75th percentile at comparator universities. The data is scrutinised by both parties relative to the agreed triggers2 to decide whether the data can be relied on in its raw form. Should it be agreed that a trigger is activated, a fresh judgement of the levels of the 75th percentile at comparator universities will be arrived at. If parties are in agreement at stage (iii) or at stage (iv), then the benchmark is submitted to the test of being sustainably affordable. If parties agree to a particular salary rise having considered the constraints of financial sustainability then it will be compared to desired differentials between ranks. If parties reach agreement about the salary rise taking into account the need to maintain appropriate differentials, then the negotiation process for salary rises is complete. A dispute may occur should agreement be failed to be reached on: what salary rise is determined by the benchmark (this may include an inability to agree on whether the data is reliable, i.e., whether a trigger should be activated); whether the salary rise determined by the benchmark is sustainably affordable; or what an appropriate rise across ranks is, given the desired differentials.   3. The Benchmark  In order to retain its leading position as a research-led university, the University must be able to attract excellent staff from within and outside of South Africa while being attractive to young people as a good career option; it is thus imperative to have an appropriate benchmark against which to measure the University's academic salary levels.  The benchmark must be constructed on the basis that the University should pay its academic staff at the upper quartile of the tertiary market (as determined by an appropriate, agreed set of comparators)3 and that such a benchmark should:   be implementable; maintain competitiveness in salaries; and be reasonably foreseen to be affordable in the medium term, i.e., sustainable.   In addition, the data must be reliable and comparable.  The benchmark for academic salaries is the 75th percentile of the market (as determined by comparison to the pay line of an agreed set of comparator universities)4. This benchmark is determined as follows:   the retrospective data indicating the 75th percentile as at January of the year in which the salary negotiations are being undertaken (i.e. January of the year preceding the increase date) is taken as the basis; the year-on-year national CPI as at end May of the year in which the salary negotiations are being undertaken, with a further adjustment for the balance of the year based on estimates from recognised and agreed sources.   This method of establishing the benchmark will be reviewed every three years.  In this way the benchmark would be informed by historical data, thus obviating the need for debate on any forward projections of future increases to be made in the market or what CPI will be in the coming year.  Although the aim in this element of the negotiation process is predicated on determining the 75th percentile of academic salaries at comparator institutions, it is acknowledged that the best available data may be deceptive5. Applying the benchmarking process over a number of years will have the effect of mitigating some of the variation in the data. Nonetheless the parties agree to monitor a set of triggers used to indicate possible unreliability in the data. These triggers include:   a detailed examination of the composition of the data set, searching for sources of incompleteness and inaccuracy; consideration of trends over the last number of years, searching for possible inexplicable movements away from the trends; a comparison of the salary rises suggested by the data with increases in CPI, searching for large discrepancies; and a comparison of the salary rises suggested by the data with increases in salaries in the general job market, searching for large discrepancies.   In any year in which there are grounds for treating the data with some suspicion, those grounds must be articulated and used to arrive at a judgement on a reasonable implementation of the benchmark.  In addition, a review of staff turnover and retention data should be considered in order to determine the adequacy of the benchmark. (See below.)  4. The measure of sustainability  Financial sustainability is a necessary consideration in any pay policy and consequently a discussion of the sustainability of proposed increases is likely to form a part of annual salary negotiations. In order to link admissible salary rises to the underlying financial health of the University, it is agreed that the evaluation of sustainability be made against an agreed set of indicators.  The criteria to be used for discussions on financial sustainability should be a set of data using metrics looking back over a number of years. The indicators of financial sustainability are:   the amount of University's free cash reserves as assessed6 by the March meeting of the UFC, total academic salaries as a percentage of agreed metrics (which could include operating surplus and some form of staff spend to student volume ratio FTE:SLE); and total academic salaries measured against subsidies and fees.   It is understood that any particular event that is likely to have a medium to long-term effect on the above metrics, can be raised by the University in any discussions on sustainability: for example, external events such as a change in subsidy.  Management will have the right to argue that considerations of sustainability may, in a particular year, justify a settlement below the figures dictated by the Benchmark. The Union will have the right to argue that in a particular year sustainability considerations allow and performance warrants a settlement above the Benchmark.  5. The differentials between academic ranks  In line with the recommendations from the RFJ task team and national and international benchmarking, there should be appropriate differentials between ranks.  The pay policy accommodates a set of differentials between ranks, to provide incentives across the life-span of an academic career, yet maintaining solidarity across ranks.  The suggested differential target between ranks to strive for is 18-22%, with 20% being the ideal. The tolerance level of 2% above and below the ideal of 20% ensures that the target does not become excessively rigid and recognizes the fact that a choice to bring the differentials to the desired norm, may not be compatible with achieving the 75th percentile at a given rank. Nonetheless the rationale for benchmarking salaries requires that salaries are benchmarked at each rank; in addition, large movements away from these targets will frustrate efficient implementation of the policy in future years. Thus the benchmarking element of the policy has a priority over the targeting of differentials between ranks. This policy envisages a process in which benchmarking is carried out and then an attempt is made to impose a structure on salaries which approaches the targeted differentials between ranks; but in doing so a movement from the benchmark figures which exceeds 3.5% will not be permitted.  The targets for differentials between ranks are to be reviewed at least every three years.  6. Review of the policy  The benchmark and the means of tracking it should be reviewed every three years as a matter of course; but may be reviewed at an earlier stage should circumstances require it. The policy has been written in a particular governmental and economic climate and with certain goals in mind. Should there be evidence of radical change in the climate or that the chosen benchmark and mechanism of tracking it are failing to meet the goals of the policy the parties agree to review the pertinent sections. The relevant items include:   Large shifts in levels of inflation; Significant changes in the mandate of the reserve bank with regards to inflation targeting; Data indicating a failure to attract and retain quality academic staff; Large shifts in government policy on funding in higher education; Changes in the higher education sector indicating an inappropriateness in the chosen comparator universities. Sustained tension between the benchmark and the targeted differentials.    1 The new name for the RFJ.  2 Here an indicator is a piece of data used to determine the level of another item (e.g. salaries or percentage rises); a trigger is a piece of data used to determine whether some further process is required (e.g. interrogation of a set of data). Some triggers, e.g those monitored by the UFC, will be known long in advance.  3 The comparators identified are the following Universities which constitute a set of the research-led Universities in South Africa: WITS, UKZN, UP, US, NWU, NMMU, UJ, Rhodes, and UFS.  4 The comparison is between the UCT SASP and the comparator universities' salaries excluding HoD allowances.  5 Reasons for this include:   incomplete data sets arising from failure of some institutions to upload their data; and inclusion of out of date data arising from some institutions failing to update their data sets timeously.   6 This assessment will be provided as a matter of course.

Annual leave is granted at times mutually agreed between the staff member and his or her line manager consistent with reasonable operational requirements.  From a wellness point of view, staff are encouraged to take their annual leave, as it reduces stress and improves quality of work. Sick leave is provided in times of illness or injury to ensure that our staff do not have to work while sick.  Applicable to   Senior leadership group (VC, DVCs, Deans, EDs, GSB Director, Registrar) All academic and PASS staff on permanent conditions of service whether in full- or part-time employment Joint staff (with conditions) All academic and PASS staff on fixed-term contracts (T1 and T2 leave conditions) Post-retirement contracts (usually T1 leave conditions) Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff (staff of a temporary nature, with variable hours) Internships and learnerships (usually T1 leave conditions)   Not applicable to   Volunteers Visiting academics and other staff Staff not on UCT conditions of service, for example SHAWCO. Time off as a result of injury on duty is covered by the Occupational health policy.   Policy details  Definition | General | Annual leave | Sick leave | Parental leave | Family responsibility leave | Special leave | Payment and transfer of leave | Unpaid leave | Absence without leave (AWOL)   Definition    1.1. There is an obligation on the staff member to be working in order to be remunerated. Leave is permission, usually from the line manager, to be away from work - under one of the leave categories contained in this policy.    General   2.1. The University closes on public holidays, when the only staff required to report for duty are those in whose areas services must be maintained. These include, but are not limited to, Campus Protection Services, the residences and the medical school.  2.2. Leave is managed by line managers and heads of department, who approve leave according to operational requirements and in the interests of staff wellness. In particular, the amount of untaken leave needs to be monitored as this is a liability on departmental budgets.  2.3. In the case of extended sick leave due to poor health, proper leave records are necessary to access the Income Continuation and Rehabilitation benefit.  2.4. Proper recording of sick and annual leave is essential as an accurate record is required in situations of poor performance, or when a disciplinary process becomes necessary.    Annual leave   Annual leave subsections:   3.1 Permanent and T2 academic and joint staff 3.2 Permanent and T2 PASS staff 3.3 PASS and academic staff on T1 contracts 3.4 Part time staff and parts of a month 3.5 Conversion of annual to sick leave 3.6 Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    3.1. Permanent and T2 academic and joint staff    Accrual and carry over   3.1.1. The number of annual leave days which accrue each year is 22, to be taken each calendar year in agreement with the Head of Department in general and with the Dean for Heads of Department. In setting the guidelines of 22 days per annum, the University recognises that academics ordinarily do not work during the period between Christmas and New Year (27 December – 31 December). Where the staff member is required to work in this period, the corresponding number of working days is granted as leave during the year, to be arranged in advance as no leave is carried forward to the following year.   Application and taking of annual leave   3.1.2. Academic staff wishing to take annual leave must obtain approval from the Head of Department. A form is not required centrally but records must be kept in the department.   3.1.3. Approval of leave rests with the line manager or HOD provided that operational requirements allow for it. If a Head of Department, approval is given by the Dean and if a Dean by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor nominated for this purpose by the Vice-Chancellor.     3.2. Permanent and T2 PASS staff    Accrual and carry over   3.2.1. Annual leave accrues monthly at the rate of 2.17 or 2.83 days, based on 26 or 34 working days per annum in calendar year cycles (see summary table).   3.2.2. Depending on the level of staff, annual leave is made up of (see summary table):   PC 1 - 12: 19 compulsory leave days and 7 accumulative leave days PC 13 peromnes grade 4-5: 18 compulsory leave days and 8 accumulative leave days Executive Directors and The Registrar: 26 compulsory leave days and 8 accumulative leave days    3.2.3. Staff employed prior to 1977 who are entitled to long leave (a historical type of leave which has been discontinued) are not entitled to accumulative annual leave.   3.2.4. A staff member may not take leave before it has accrued. He or she may take annual leave in the year in which he or she earns it, or in the calendar year following the year in which he or she earns it (for T2, by end of June of the following year).    Example A member of staff who joins on 1 January of a given year will be allowed to take annual leave that has accrued to a particular moment in time. In other words, if he or she wanted to take leave in June, 13 days would be available (2.17 days per month x 6 months).     3.2.5. Accrued compulsory annual leave not taken by the end of the following calendar year is lost (for T2, by end of June of the following year), unless the Head of Department can show, via a written motivation to the satisfaction of the Executive Director: HR that there were good operational reasons why the leave could not be taken. Leave to be postponed in this way must be requested before completion of the calendar year concerned and must be taken as early as possible in the following year.   3.2.6. Accumulative annual leave (permanent only, not T2) has the following maximums, which may be carried over indefinitely:     Staff grouping Maximum accumulative leave   PC 1-4 up to 28   PC 5-12 up to 42   PC 13 PG 4-5 PC 13 PG 3 (EDs and Registrar) up to 50      3.2.7. Once the maximum has been reached, accumulative leave is accrued as compulsory leave and must be used as per 3.2.5.   Application for annual leave   3.2.8. PASS staff wishing to take annual leave must apply to their line manager, using the standard leave application form (HR140).   3.2.9. The decision to grant leave rests with the line manager provided that operational requirements reasonably allow for it and the staff member has leave due to him/her.   Taking of leave   3.2.10. The maximum leave that can be taken at any one time is 50 working days.   3.2.11. Staff who take leave between the Day of Goodwill (26th December) and New Year's day must apply for leave in the usual way.   3.2.12. A staff member is not permitted to take annual leave in excess of his or her total leave credit (i.e. current accrual of compulsory leave plus any accumulated leave). Any leave taken in excess of this will be unpaid leave (see: Unpaid leave).   3.2.13. A Head of Department may refuse to grant leave during a staff member's notice period, prior to resignation.     3.3. PASS and academic staff on T1 contracts    3.3.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, 1.25 days per month worked (or 15 working days per year from the anniversary date) is accrued as annual leave.   3.3.2. Only leave which has accrued to date may be taken as annual leave.     3.4. Part-time staff and parts of a month    3.4.1. For part-time staff, leave is accrued as per 3.1. (academic and joint staff), 3.2. (PASS) or 3.3. (T1 contracts) and pro-rated as follows:     Working.. Earns..   1 day per week 20% of the full-time entitlement   2 days per week 40% of the full-time entitlement   3 days per week 60% of the full-time entitlement   4 days per week 80% of the full-time entitlement   This calculation also applies to the other types of leave.      3.4.2. If a person works part of a month, annual leave entitlement is calculated as follows:     Formula   Full-time entitlement   ÷ Calendar days in the month   x Calendar days employed   Worked example: A staff member starts work on November 10.   2.17 days   ÷ 30 days   x 21 days   = 1.5 days [Result]        3.5. Conversion of annual leave to sick leave    3.5.1. Annual leave may be converted to sick leave under exceptional circumstances only. A written motivation with HOD/line manager’s support must be supplied as well as a medical certificate, and final approval rests with the EDHR.     3.6. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    3.6.1. In line with the BCEA, leave accrues at the rate of 1 hour per 17 hours worked, provided the staff member works more than 24 hours in the month.   3.6.2. Leave may be taken subject to approval during the contract, or the hours claimed as leave pay on a monthly basis.      Sick leave   4.1. Legal definitions    4.1.1. Ill-health incapacity is the failure or inability of a staff member to work according to the requirements of the position as a result of ill-health (including mental ill-health) or injury. In the case of incapacity for reasons of ill-health or injury, no fault can be attributed to the staff member, and is not the same as poor performance incapacity.   4.1.2. Incapacity due to ill health or injury is assessed relative to the requirements of the position. It can be a partial, temporary, short-term, long-term, or permanent condition and is managed accordingly. See also: Disability through ill health.   4.1.3. Sick leave is provided for in cases of temporary, short-term incapacity for reasons of ill health or injury as per 4.1.1.   4.1.4. Sick leave is not provided if a staff member is fit to work.     4.2. Accruals: Permanent PASS and academic staff    4.2.1. A staff member may be granted sick leave on full pay for a total of not more than 30 calendar days during the first year of service, for a total of not more than 60 calendar days during the first two years of service, and for a total of not more than 90 calendar days during the first three years of service.   4.2.2. A person who has completed at least three years of service may, in each cycle of six years from the date of appointment, be granted sick leave for a total of 180 calendar days of which not more than 90 shall be on full pay and the remainder on half pay.  Summary: A permanent staff member earns 30 calendar days full pay sick leave per annum on the anniversary date for the first 3 years of the 6 year cycle. He or she earns 30 calendar days half pay sick leave per annum for years 4 to 6 of the 6 year cycle. In total this will be 90 calendar days full pay and 90 calendar days half pay over 6 years. In the second and subsequent cycles, all sick leave accrues in advance.     4.3. Accruals: PASS and academic staff on T1/T2 contracts    4.3.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, 1 day per month worked is accrued as sick leave.   4.3.2. Only sick leave which has accrued to date may be taken.     4.4. Accruals: Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    4.4.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, leave accrues at the rate of 1 day paid sick leave per 26 days worked. This will be prorated according to the number of hours worked.   4.4.2. Only sick leave which has accrued to date may be taken.     4.5. Application for sick leave    4.5.1. If a staff member becomes unable to perform in his or her position due to ill health or injury (see Section 4.1 Legal definitions) during the course of the working day, at whatever time, and is given leave to go home by his or her line manager, a full day’s sick leave must be taken.   4.5.2. All staff members must produce a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner in respect of any sick leave for periods of more than two days. At the discretion of the Head of Department, a medical certificate may be required for all periods of sick leave especially where there is a pattern or suspicion of abuse.   4.5.3. The diagnosis indicated on the certificate need not be fully disclosed but must be within the expected competencies and permitted practices for the licensed individual who is issuing it. The certificate must clearly state that the person is unfit for work (see Section 4.1 Legal definitions) and give the dates for which he or she is booked off.   4.5.4. A staff member who is absent from work owing to injury or illness must immediately make every effort to inform his or her head of department or line manager of the reason for the absence and he or she must continue to do so daily until a medical certificate, which specifies the period of sick leave, has been provided. This practice applies to any day which is not covered by a sick leave certificate.   4.5.5. On returning to work, the sick leave taken must be reported using form HR140.     4.6. When sick leave runs out    4.6.1. The following measures may be possible in exceptional circumstances when sick leave runs out, with a written motivation and HOD/line manager’s support:    sick leave may be taken as unpaid and/or;   available half pay sick leave may be converted to full pay sick leave and/or;   annual leave may be recorded as sick leave at the rate of 1 day’s annual leave for 1 day’s sick leave if annual leave is available.     4.6.2. Final approval for the above measures lies with the Executive Director: Human Resources and will not, as a general rule, be granted unless:    a medical certificate has been provided; and   the period of absence on sick leave is longer than 14 days; and   the absence on sick leave was the result of serious illness or injury, other than that for which a claim has been approved under Workmen’s Compensation Assistance (WCA); and/or failure to do so would lead to a staff member experiencing extraordinary financial hardship.       4.7. Return to work and light duty    4.7.1. There shall be reasonable accommodation for a staff member affected by an injury or illness-related condition following a period of sick leave. Partial incapacity is normally a temporary condition and is managed accordingly (see Section 4.1 for a definition of incapacity).   4.7.2. If light duty has been requested, it must be supported with a certificate from a registered medical practitioner.   4.7.3. Light duty, if operationally possible, will be determined by the line manager and Human Resources in consultation with the medical practitioner.   4.7.4. Where it is not possible to accommodate light duty, and full, long-term or permanent incapacity is determined, the staff member may be able to access the Income Continuation and Rehabilitation benefit. See: Disability through ill health.      Parental leave (incorporates both previous categories of maternity and paternity leave)   5.1. Guiding principles    5.1.1. UCT's parental leave policy is structured to be as inclusive of as many family arrangements as possible.   5.1.2. Where both parents are UCT staff, they are given the flexibility to decide how the parental leave entitlement will be shared between them, see Section 5.2.6.     5.2. Entitlement    5.2.1. A permanent or T2 staff member is entitled to four months' full pay parental leave if he or she is giving birth and keeping the child, or is the primary adoptive parent (formerly maternity leave).   5.2.2. Alternatively, a permanent or T2 staff member is entitled to five days full pay parenting partner leave if he or she is the legal guardian in either a case of adoption or birth (formerly paternity leave).   5.2.3. A birth mother or primary adoptive parent on a T1 contract is entitled to four months unpaid parental leave.   5.2.4. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff are not entitled to paid or unpaid parental leave. If the pregnancy and birth fall within the period of the ad hoc contract, the contract staff member and line manager should re-negotiate the contract.   5.2.5. Any additional time off required for medical reasons must meet the requirements for incapacity (see 4.1.1), be supported by a valid medical certificate and be taken as sick leave.   5.2.6. Where both parents are UCT staff members:    they must declare via affidavit that they are taking parental leave for the same child(ren), and must submit their leave applications together;   the leave entitlement (parental or adoption, plus parenting partner leave) may be shared between the two parents, taking into account the legislative requirements in clause 5.3; and   leave periods of a shared leave entitlement may overlap or run concurrently.       5.3. Legislative requirements    5.3.1. A pregnant staff member who is entitled to parental leave as per section 5.2 may commence parental leave:    any time from four weeks before the expected date of birth, unless otherwise agreed between the staff member and her Head of Department;   on a date from which a medical practitioner or midwife certifies that it is necessary for the health of the staff member or her unborn child.     5.3.2. In compliance with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, a staff member may not work for six weeks after the birth of her child, unless a medical practitioner or midwife certifies that she is fit to do so.     5.4. Adoption    5.4.1. Where a staff member gives up her baby for adoption, parental leave will end no later than six weeks after the birth of the child.   5.4.2. Where a permanent or T2 staff member adopts a child (under one year of age), he or she is entitled to four months paid parental leave if the primary adoptive parent. This may be shared, as per Section 5.2.6, if both adoptive parents work at UCT.   5.4.3. Where a permanent or T2 staff member adopts an older child, she or he may apply via their line manager to the Executive Director: Human Resources for parental leave.   5.4.4. Each case is considered on its merits, and the amount of parental leave granted depends on the circumstances of each case (to the maximum of four months paid parental leave if the primary adoptive parent).     5.5. Application    5.5.1. The staff member must notify his or her line manager in writing of the date on which he or she intends to commence parental leave and return to work afterwards, using form HR140.   5.5.2. Such notification must be given four weeks before the staff member intends to commence parental leave, or as soon as possible thereafter.   5.5.3. Supporting documentation may be required either before or after the birth/adoption from the birth parent and/or non-birth parent in the form of a marriage certificate, declaration or affidavit, birth registration papers or adoption papers.     5.6. Miscarriage    5.6.1. A staff member who has a miscarriage during the third trimester of pregnancy or bears a still-born child is entitled to parental leave for six weeks regardless of whether or not she had commenced parental leave at the time. Should the staff member require additional time off work for either medical or compassionate reasons, application can be made for sick leave or family responsibility leave. A certificate from a registered medical practitioner is required.   5.6.2. Should the miscarriage occur prior to the third trimester, sick leave must be used. See: Sick leave.     5.7. Additional leave    5.7.1. Where requested, additional leave must be granted immediately following a period of parental leave as follows:    a birth mother or primary adoptive parent will be granted unpaid leave or annual leave, or a combination of annual and unpaid leave until the child is six months old. See: Unpaid leave.   a parenting partner will be granted an additional five working days of leave, either as part of his or her annual leave or as unpaid leave.     5.7.2. Additional unpaid leave for an adoption would be part of the negotiated leave amount as per 5.4.4.     5.8. Flexible working hours    5.8.1. Parents are entitled to request flexible working hours for a period of up to six months after returning to work. While this may not be possible in all cases, the request will receive due consideration and will not be unreasonably withheld.   5.8.2. Time worked in a flexible capacity may not be less than twenty hours per week.   5.8.3. Payment will be pro-rated on the basis of hours worked in the month. A new COE (Cost of Employment) schedule must be signed, indicating how the staff member wishes to structure his or her COE.     5.9. Health, safety and welfare of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers    5.9.1. Time off work is granted for pregnant staff members to visit routine antenatal clinics once a month during the term of pregnancy, subject to:    only the necessary time being taken and return to work after the appointment if this is before the end of the working day;   submission of a medical certificate confirming pregnancy;   authorisation for such leave of absence being obtained 24 hours in advance (where possible); and   proof of attendance being subsequently furnished by the staff member.     5.9.2. A pregnant staff member, or one who is nursing a child, will not be engaged in work that would be hazardous to her health or the health of the child. During the staff member's pregnancy, and for up to six months after the birth of the child, UCT will provide suitable, alternative employment on terms and conditions that are no less favourable than her ordinary terms and conditions of employment, provided that it is practicable to do so.   5.9.3. There shall be reasonable accommodation for breastfeeding mothers with regard to work schedules and facilities for a period of at least 12 months from the date of birth.     5.10. Return to work    5.10.1. On his or her return to work, the staff member's COE will be at least at the same level as it had been when he or she went on parental leave.   5.10.2. If the COE of other staff in his or her department has been reviewed during the period of parental leave, the Head of Department will review and, if appropriate, adjust the staff member’s COE when he or she returns to work.      Family responsibility leave   6.1. Eligibility    6.1.1. Permanent and T2 staff, employed for more than 4 days per week, are entitled to 5 days family responsibility leave per year from the anniversary date of the current employment contract.   6.1.2. Staff on T1 contracts are entitled to 3 days family responsibility leave per year, as provided for in section 27 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997.   6.1.3. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff are not entitled to family responsibility leave.   6.1.4. Family responsibility leave expires each year on the anniversary date.     6.2. Definition    6.2.1. Family responsibility leave may be granted where:    an immediate family member is ill and in need of medical attention from a registered medical practitioner, and where the staff member is required to take care of the ill person; or   upon the death of an immediate family member.     6.2.2. In the case of 6.2.1 above immediate family members include spouse, life partner, parent, adoptive parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, child, adoptive child, grandchild and sibling.   6.2.3. The decision to grant leave rests with the Head of Department provided that the staff member has family responsibility leave due to him or her and operational requirements allow for it.     6.3. Application for family responsibility leave    6.3.1. Application for family responsibility leave must be made in advance if possible, using form HR140. The leave can be taken from the total allocation as a block of consecutive days or in any other combination.   6.3.2.

However staff are obliged, whatever they elect to do, to pay the full cost of risk and death benefits.   7.6.6. Group Life cover continues for the period, but entirely at the cost of the staff member. In the case of UCTRF members the Group Life cost is part of the full cost of risk and death benefits.   7.6.7.

Examination Formal assessment intended to measure the student or learner's progress, skill, knowledge or qualification. These may be formal written examinations or tests, oral examinations or presentations, or other written submissions such as a thesis or dissertation.     Policy details   General    1.1. UCT supports PASS staff members undertaking developmental formal learning and development, through the provision of study and examination leave. Study and examination leave is to be used for the explicit purpose of preparing for examination or for the examination itself.  1.2. A leave of absence to attend developmental formal learning and development may be granted by the line manager. Subject to the approval of the line manager, provided that the staff member provides the line manager with a lecture timetable, provided that the time is made up to his/her satisfaction, and provided that operational requirements allow it, a staff member may be permitted to attend five lectures weekly. In this instance, lectures refer to normal short lectures of an hour or so each.  1.3. A leave of absence to attend or to be assessed for position-related learning and development is at the discretion of the line manager. This is treated as a normal working day and not as leave.  1.4. Study and examination leave will not be granted where the learning and development is of a personal nature. In this case, annual leave must be used.  1.5. Study and examination leave will not be granted where the learning and development is non-formal or informal, as these typically do not undergo formal assessment requiring dedicated preparation time.    Eligibility   2.1 The policy applies to PASS staff undertaking formal developmental learning and development and who wish to apply for a leave of absence to prepare for an examination and the examination itself.    Criteria   3.1 To qualify, the course of study must meet the following criteria:   The course is formal in nature; and The course is examined or formally assessed; and The course is done through a recognised, reputable institution; and The course is developmental or position-related; and The course was identified as part of the Development Dialogue (DD) process.     Period   4.1 Up to 12 days study and examination leave may be granted in any one calendar year in total in the following two categories combined:  4.2 Preparation purposes    4.2.1 One day study and examination leave may be granted per examination in order to prepare for a written or oral examination, up to a maximum of 6 days.  4.2.2 Up to 6 days study and examination leave will be granted to prepare written submission for formal examination where this submission is the main form of examination.  4.2.3 In the case of PhD or Masters, up to 12 days study and examination leave will be granted to prepare written submission for formal examination where this submission is the main form of examination.  4.2.4 Any further leave required must be taken as annual leave.    4.3 Examination purposes    4.3.1 One day study and examination leave may be granted per examination for the examination itself where the examination falls within normal working hours.  4.3.2 Where an examination is taken in the morning, only half a day's study and examination leave will be granted, and the staff member will be required to return to work for the afternoon  4.3.3 Where an examination falls outside of normal working hours (e.g. evenings and weekends), study and examination leave for the examination will not be granted.      Accrual   5.1 There is no accrual of study and examination leave.  5.2 There is no entitlement to study and examination leave.  5.3 For part-time staff, the number of study and examination leave days is reduced according to their normal work schedule.      Example A Part-time staff whose working day is less than the full 7.5 hours per day may be granted 12 days of study and examination leave where each leave day is based on the same number of hours they would normally have worked.  Example B Part-time staff working less than 5 days per week may be granted study and examination leave calculated on a pro-rata basis according to the percentage time worked. Therefore a staff member who works 4 days per week (80% of the week) may be granted 80% of the study and examination leave, 9.6 days.        Procedures   6.1 Application   Applications must be made online on Employee Self-Service or on the leave form (HR140). Applications must be made to the line manager. Original or certified copy of the examination timetable, or a letter from the institution outlining the examination process and/or dates, or an original letter from the lecturer/supervisor supporting leave in the case of written submission, must be attached to the leave form. Leave may not be taken without prior approval. Approved leave forms are forwarded to the Human Resources Department for record keeping on the payroll system.  Online leave applications are stored on the payroll system following approval by the line manager.   6.2 Authority and approval   Study and examination leave for preparation purposes must, within reason, be taken at times operationally convenient to the department and as such may not always be granted for the days directly before the examination. Operational requirements must be taken into account. Flexible working hours may also be considered. The line manager has authority to grant or refuse applications for study and examination leave.

"Purpose | Policy | Process flows  Purpose  The purpose of this policy is to clarify University of Cape Town's employee assistance programme for staff who are substance dependant.  Policy  UCT recognises that substance abuse may be disruptive and detrimental to a safe working environment, employee morale, attendance and productivity. We view substance dependency as in many cases an incurable but treatable and controllable health problem. This document sets out what assistance will be provided, and under what terms that assistance will be provided by UCT to employees who are affected if that is what they choose.  Employees who are subject to substance dependency may seek support, or may be counselled to seek support through the employee assistance programme in which case they will be referred to the Organisational Health Advisor through the line manager. Where an employee who is being assisted under this programme refuses the assistance offered or where the counsellor reports a relapse as a result of non-compliance with an agreed-upon programme, further assistance may be denied.  We recognise the value of preventative education on the subject of substances and will ensure that relevant information is available to staff supported by HR and line management.  We do not allow employees   to appear to be or be under the influence of substances or engage in substance-related activities in the workplace; or to have in their possession intoxicating liquor or illegal drugs in the workplace. (Alcohol may, however, be consumed at University functions and licensed premises on campus. We require individuals not to abuse this privilege.)   Substance abuse/dependency can result in misconduct (i.e. a breach of a work requirement or standard of behaviour) or incapacity (i.e. inability to perform services to the required standard). Substance-related misconduct or incapacity or poor performance may lead to disciplinary action especially but not only where:   an employee has refused the assistance offered and/or failed to co-operate with treatment/counselling as agreed upon and/or has had a relapse as a result of non-compliance with treatment/counselling. where safety is compromised.

"See: Emergency Care Procedures   The Occupational Health and Safety Act No 85 of 1993 requires UCT to provide and maintain, as far as is reasonably practicable, a working environment that is safe and without risk to the health of employees, students and visitors. As required by the Act, UCT has safety committees, and every area has an elected Health and Safety Representative. Health and safety, as conceived by the Occupational Health and Safety Act, is everyone's responsibility yet Council has included a specific responsibility in the duties of the Vice-Chancellor, Executive Officers and Heads of Departments. This makes the head responsible for safety in his/her department, including, but not limited to the responsibility of ensuring that students, staff and visitors to the department are safeguarded and protected from physical risk, and that safe working procedures are adhered to at all times.  The Occupational Health and Safety Act places specific and particular responsibilities on the Vice-Chancellor of the University, who is charged with the responsibility of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act. The Act provides that the Vice-Chancellor may, without derogating from his/her responsibilities and liabilities, assign to any person any duty contemplated in the Act.   General duties of employees at work:  To take reasonable care for the health and safety of himself and of other persons who may be affected by his acts or omissions. As regards any duty or requirement imposed on his employer or any other person by this Act, to co-operate with such employer or person to enable that duty or requirement to be performed or complied with. To carry out any lawful order given to him, and obey the health and safety rules and procedures laid down by his employer or by anyone authorised thereto by his employer, in the interest of health or safety. Should any unsafe or unhealthy situation come to his attention, to report it as soon as possible to his employer or to the relevant Health and Safety Representative who will report it to the employer. If he is involved in any incident which may affect his health or which has caused an injury to himself, to report such incident to his employer or to anyone authorised thereto by the employer, or to his Health and Safety Representative. This should be done as soon as possible, but not later than the end of the particular shift during which the incident occurred (unless the circumstances were such that the reporting of the incident was not possible, in which case he shall report the incident as soon as possible thereafter).     Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, 1993. This legislation provides mechanisms for compensation to staff members who are injured on duty, or who suffer from occupational illnesses. It provides rules for claims, and for notifying the commissioner of accidents and diseases. The following list some of the features of the system that are likely to be of direct interest to university staff (subject to new legislation being passed)   The Act provides for the payment of benefits to an ""employee"" injured or ill as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his/her employment. All members of staff, regardless of salary, are covered under this Act. A compensation fund is established in terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, which is applied by the Commissioner to payment of compensation, medical aid or other benefit to, on behalf of, or in respect of employees, in terms of the Act. The Act makes it mandatory for an employer to report to the commissioner all accidents arising out of and in the course of employment which result in personal injury. It is essential that any accident (no matter how slight) be reported immediately by the employee/s involved (or those who witnessed) to the Head of Department who will, in turn  request the departmental Health and Safety Representative to carry out an investigation, and advise the Occupational Health Nurse or the Insurance Officer (under UCT Finance Department) who will, in turn, send a W.CL.2/100(E) and annexure 2 forms for completion. all accidents are reported by the Insurance Office to the Occupational Health and Safety Office as soon as possible after the event. In the normal course of events, accidents must be reported to the Commissioner within 14 days.   The injured staff must seek any required medical treatment as soon as possible. If he/she requires medical treatment, the Department Head must complete the official form W.CL.2/100(E), obtainable from the Insurance Office or Occupational Health Nurse, and send PART B along with the injured staff member to the doctor or hospital. The original of the official form, PART A, must be sent back to the Insurance Office. The annexure 2 form must be kept by the department as it will form part of the accident register which is maintained by each departmental Health and Safety Representative.  When completing form W.CL.2/100(E) the following points should be noted:   Item 3(d) states that a full description of the accident must be given. Item 10 and 12 must always be fully completed (i.e. the dates and times of going off duty as a result of accident, and of resuming duty). Minor injuries which do not require medical treatment and those that do not result in absence from work for more than three days need not be reported to the Commissioner. The annexure 2 form must however be obtained from the Insurance Office or the Occupational Health Nurse, completed and retained. This will be kept on file for reference should complications arise. The departmental Health and Safety Representative must again be advised.   Further information and guidance may be obtained from the Insurance Office, Finance Department at UCT.   Reporting accidents under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, No 85 of 1993.  In terms of section 24 of the Act, read with General Administrative Regulation 9, the employer or user of machinery must report to an inspector within 14 days (using the prescribed form obtainable from the Occupational Health and Safety Office). Section 24 reads as follows: ""24 (1) Each incident occurring at work or arising out of or in connection with the activities of persons at work, or in connection with the use of plant or machinery, in which, or in consequence of which -  (a) any person dies, becomes unconscious, suffers the loss of a limb or part of a limb or is otherwise injured or becomes ill to such a degree that he is likely either to die or suffer a permanent physical defect or likely to be unable for a period of at least 14 days either to work or to continue with the activity of which he was employed or is usually employed;  (b) a major incident occurred; or  (c) the health or safety of any person was endangered and where -  (i) a dangerous substance was spilled;  (ii) the uncontrolled release of any substance under pressure took place;  (iii) machinery or any part thereof fractured or failed resulting in flying, falling or uncontrolled moving objects; or  (iv) machinery ran out of control, shall, within the prescribed period and in the prescribed manner, be reported to an inspector by the employer or the user of the plant or machinery concerned, as the case may be.  (2) In the event of an incident in which a person died, or was injured to such an extent that he is likely to die, or suffered the loss of a limb or part of a limb. no person shall without the consent of an inspector disturb the site at which the incident occurred or remove any article or substance involved in the incident therefrom: Provided that such action may be taken as is necessary to prevent a further incident, to remove the injured or dead, or to rescue persons from danger.  (3) The provisions of subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply in respect of -  (a) a traffic accident on a public road;  (b) an incident occurring in a private household, provided the householder forthwith reports the incident to the South African Police; or  (c) any accident which is to be investigated under section 12 of the Aviation Act, 1962 (Act No. 74 of 1962).  (4) A member of the South African Police to whom an incident was reported in terms of subsection (3) (b), shall forthwith notify an inspector thereof.""  General Administrative Regulations 9 paragraphs (1) and (2) refers to witnesses at an Inquiry and reads as follows: ""9 (1) When an inspector is directed to hold a formal inquiry into an incident in terms of section 21 (1) of the Act, he or she shall notify the employer or user concerned, as the case may be, of the date, time and place of such inquiry and such employer or user shall forthwith advise those persons who witnessed the incident and any other person specified by the inspector, of such date, time and place, and that their presence shall be required at the inquiry.  (2) The employer or user concerned, as the case may be, shall ascertain which of the persons he or she has advised in terms of subregulation (1) are likely to refuse to attend the inquiry, and shall forthwith advise the inspector of the name sand addresses of such persons in other that the inspector can subpoena such persons.""  Any further information may be obtained from the Occupational Health and Safety Office     Emergency Care Procedures   The staff at the Student Health Service (SHS) are trained and equipped to handle medical emergencies, but the co-operation and assistance of staff is required. What to do in a medical emergency  Call the Student Health Service  upper campus ext. 3545 lower campus ext. 3662   Tell the receptionist that there is an emergency and ask to speak to a doctor or nurse If necessary, call EMS ER24 on 084124 (speed-dial 8110). When staff call the Student Health Service they should indicate  who they are and where the patient is (which building, which floor, the room/lecture theatre) the nature and severity of the problem (e.g. a staff member has collapsed during a lecture and is unconscious, cold and sweaty; a student fainted during an examination, but has regained consciousness and is alert and oriented; a worker fell off a scaffolding, is bleeding from a head wound and is conscious but confused).     If a student or staff member collapses in class, staff should try to move him/her to an open space where SHS staff will have easy access to him/her. Staff should not move someone who has fallen from a height and sustained an injury. Heads of Departments should be aware of any serious/problematic medical conditions their staff members may suffer from (e.g. diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, high blood pressure, cardiac conditions). This information must be conveyed to SHS staff when they are dealing with an emergency. Heads of Departments should keep a list of people in their department or buildings who have undergone first aid training, and call them after having contacted the SHS. The SHS staff might take some time to reach the scene of the emergency, whereas someone in the building who has first aid training could be on the scene in seconds.

"Introduction | Applicable to | Not applicable to | General conditions of service | Related links  Introduction  Together with the specific details in your letter of appointment, which takes precedence, this policy overview provides important aspects of the employment contract for staff on PASS conditions of service. It must be read in conjunction with UCTs Employee relations policy for all staff. Links are provided wherever a more in-depth policy exists on an aspect of service.  Applicable to  All PASS staff in pay class 1 to 12 and pay class 13, peromnes group 4 and 5.  Not applicable to  Academic staff from assistant lecturer to professor. See: General conditions of service for academic staff.  General conditions of service   Values and principles    1.1. As an employee of the University you are required to be familiar with, and heed the UCT Mission Statement and the UCT Statement of Values (on the same web page).    Induction and requirements prior to taking up appointment   2.1. The University occasionally requires new staff in certain positions to undergo a medical examination. The purpose of the examination is to confirm the fitness of the appointee to perform the duties of the position.  2.2. In the case of citizens of countries other than South Africa who do not have residency status, the appointment is offered subject to the staff member fulfilling any legal requirements in South Africa.  2.3. PASS staff must go through an induction programme prepared by the line manager, as appropriate for the position. An induction checklist is available to facilitate this process.    Retirement funding and risk cover   3.1. All permanent and T2 PASS staff are required to become a member of the University's Retirement Fund (UCTRF). An allocation is made to this from your cost of employment (COE). As a member you receive UCTRF provident retirement benefits as well as death-in-service, funeral and disability cover. The UCTRF allows a choice of 4 investment portfolios to direct the investment of the monthly retirement funding contributions paid by the University on behalf of the staff member. Further information about the fund and these choices is available on the UCTRF website.    Medical Aid   4.1. Staff on permanent conditions of service are required to become members of the University's medical aid scheme unless they are a spouse/partner dependant on a registered South African medical aid scheme. Foreign medical insurance is not acceptable.  4.2. Staff on T2 conditions of service are required to become members of the University's medical aid scheme unless they provide proof of membership on own or partner/spouse's registered South African medical aid scheme. Foreign medical insurance is not acceptable.  4.3. Staff on T1 conditions of service do not qualify to belong to UCT's medical aid scheme.  4.4. A choice of levels and types of cover within the scheme is allowed. The medical aid contribution is a direct deduction from net pay and attracts tax relief as allowed by SARS.  See: Medical Aid policy.    Tuition fees   5.1. Staff who undertake study at UCT, or whose dependant partner or dependent children do so, may be eligible for a staff rate on tuition fees. See: Staff tuition rate policy.    Hours of work   6.1. Working hours are determined by the requirements of each particular section or department, but the following limits have been laid down:   Minimum working hours (excluding lunch and tea breaks): 37.5 hours per week, or 7.5 hours per day, for full-time staff. Part-time staff are advised of their hours of work in their letters of appointment.

Line managers must arrange with staff in their areas for coverage of business hours as operationally required. By agreement, staff may arrange to commence work between 07h30 and 09h00, and to take a break of either 30 or 60 minutes between 12h30 and 13h30. Staff are permitted to finish work between 15h30 and 17h30. Once agreed, such arrangements will be the standard for the employee or group of employees. The line manager must agree to any amendment of the standard hours, and occasional variations should first be agreed upon between the supervisor and staff member.   6.2. Library staff are required to work over weekends and/or evenings based on operational needs.  6.3. A staff member is required to adhere to the hours of work laid down for the department or section to which he or she is appointed. Notification of such hours will be given, on appointment, by the line manager.  6.4. If a staff member is late, he or she is required to inform the line manager of his or her lateness and on arrival to report immediately to the Line Manager, as time lost through lateness will not be paid for unless there is an acceptable explanation. If the staff member is unexpectedly unable to come to work, he/she must send a message to the Supervisor or Manager as soon as possible, explaining the absence and giving the date of return. Failure to comply with this provision may result in disciplinary action being taken against the staff member.  6.5. Certain categories of staff who are required to work additional time outside their normal hours of work may be paid overtime. See: Overtime policy.  6.6. Staff who work less than their prescribed number of working hours without authorisation, or who are absent without leave are subject to reductions in remuneration and disciplinary action may be taken.    Leave and arranged absences   7.1. The university does not close at any time, except for public holidays.  7.2. Staff who need or wish to be absent from their work stations during the agreed hours of work must seek prior approval for such absence.  7.3.

They are required to use their annual leave for such purposes.  7.8. Leave is paid out on termination, under conditions specified in the Leave policy.    Religious holidays   8.1. Staff members wishing to take time off to observe a religious holiday that is not a public holiday are required to use annual leave.  8.2.

Written or oral instructions about the operation of equipment or machinery must be strictly observed. Staff are not to operate machinery, motors, power switches, pipes or valves, unless specifically authorised to do so.  9.3. Where overalls and other protective clothing are provided by the University, staff are required to wear them when working. Staff working in dangerous conditions are required to wear the protective clothing provided (such as helmet or safety goggles). Failure to comply with this provision may result in disciplinary action being taken against the staff member.  9.4. If provided with such apparel, the cost will be covered by UCT.

"Purpose of policy  To explain the services available to staff who are relocating from outside of Cape Town and the borders of South Africa.  Applicable to  All staff in payclass 9 and above including Lecturer level and above who have contracts exceeding two years or are permanent appointments who are relocating from outside of Cape Town and South Africa.  Services provided   Travel For staff members who are travelling to Cape Town / South Africa by air, single economy class airtickets are arranged through UCT's preferred travel agent, Millway Sure Travel, who liaises directly with the staff member regarding a suitable flight schedule. UCT will meet the cost of the most cost-effective flight schedule, taking into account the needs of the staff member as far as possible.   UCT meets this cost directly with the travel agent. The University does not meet the cost of excess baggage.   If the staff member chooses to drive to Cape Town, the staff member is refunded the cost of single economy class air tickets for him/herself, partner and immediate dependants, upon arrival in Cape Town.  Moving of furniture The University will meet the cost of the transport of books, furniture and personal effects as stated in his/her offer of appointment. On receiving the acceptance of an offer of appointment the University requests three transport companies to contact the appointee regarding quotations for the transport of the goods concerned. Only transport companies who are registered UCT vendors are used. The appointee is required to give an indication of his/her preference, although cost is also taken into account when choosing the successful transport company. The University is not committed to the payment of any transport costs until it has received all quotations and accepted one of them.   UCT does not contribute towards the costs of transporting pets or motor vehicles, nor does it contribute to any expenditure which has not been specifically approved and accepted before it is incurred. Where required, the University will meet the cost of storage of personal effects in Cape Town for a maximum period of three months. It is important to note that UCT will meet the cost of insurance cover, if arranged before the goods are uplifted, until delivery, including the three months while the goods are in storage. Insurance cover after the three months would be for the cost of the staff member. Where required, the University will meet the cost of one re-delivery in terms of the quotation received and accepted. The cost of part deliveries must be met by the staff member, although an allowance will be made should the staff member require his/her books for her work at the University. The staff member may choose to defer the moving of his/her furniture, as in the case where the staff member's family joins him/her at a later stage, but the move can only be deferred for 12 months. If a staff member decides not to make use of the moving service, no payment will be made to the staff member in lieu thereof.   Settlement allowances  A settlement allowance of R5 000 per household is granted to members of staff recruited from outside of Cape Town. A settlement allowance of R10 000 per household is granted to members of staff recruited from outside the republic of South Africa. This allowance is paid to the staff member tax-free upon arrival in Cape Town.   Accommodation UCT temporary accommodation is made available to new staff members joining the University from outside of Cape Town and South Africa, depending on availability thereof, for a maximum period of six months. Applications for extension beyond this period will not be considered.   Upon receipt of the staff member's formal acceptance, the staff member is encouraged to make direct contact with Staff Housing, to find out if accommodation will be available. The staff member can choose between a furnished apartment or a furnished cottage, depending on what is available at the time. Payment for rental of the apartment/cottage will be made directly from the staff member's salary. Should UCT accommodation not be available, the staff member can be put on a waiting list until accommodation becomes available.   In the event that Staff Housing is unable to accommodate the staff member, UCT accommodation will not be available to the staff member at a later stage.  Repayment of travel, transport and settlement allowances Should the staff member leave the University before three years have expired (or in the case of a fixed term contract appointment, before the expiry of the contract) he/she must refund such part of the monetary allowance as is proportionate to the unexpired portion of three years (or in the case of a fixed term contract appointment, the unexpired portion of the contract).  Should a staff member leave the University, the University will not be responsible for the payment of his/her relocation from Cape Town.    Page last updated: 19 May 2016    Share on",Relocation

(Read more)       Purpose  The purpose of the probationary period is to test the presumption of the appointment, namely, that there is a basis for a long term employment relationship between the member of staff and the University. It is to give the new academic the opportunity of a planned induction, training and appropriate support to gain experience and competence in teaching, research and administration so as to ensure a smooth transition from being a new staff member to becoming an established member of the University, and to afford a period of adjustment for an established academic to become acquainted with the University and its academic and governance systems, and structures.  The aim of this policy is to ensure fairness; no staff member should be disadvantaged, either through having his or her probation extended or through dismissal, should the University fail substantially to implement these procedures. The timelines incorporated in the policy guarantee practicability and sufficient flexibility. However if the procedures cannot be implemented because of lack of compliance by the staff member then any reasonable sanction may be imposed by the University on the member concerned.  Applicable to  This policy applies to all newly appointed permanent staff on academic conditions of service (including standard academic staff, academic teaching staff, and clinical academic staff).  The probationary period may be reduced or waived if the staff member has undertaken a successful probationary period at another institution which the University believes is equivalent, or has previously been employed at UCT in a similar capacity.  An academic member of staff appointed on a T2 contract (&gt;2 years and &lt; 5 years) will be required to serve probation if it is specified in his or her employment contract.  Not applicable to   PASS staff Research staff Ad Hoc or paid-on-claim staff T1 contracts T2 contracts where probation is not specified in the employment contract   Policy details   Length of the probationary period is normally 3 years but may be longer or shorter if special circumstances exist.    1.1. Normal period  The normal period of probation is three years.  In the case of a member of staff on a T2 contract being required to serve probation, the period of probation and the timing of the assessments must be specified in the employment contract.   1.2. Shorter or longer period, and waiver of period  A shorter or longer period of probation can exceptionally be approved by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (DVC) responsible for academic matters on the recommendation of the selection committee. If approved, it must be documented in the letter of appointment.   1.3. Use of previous service  Previous full-time service at UCT may be taken into account to satisfy part of the probationary service requirement, provided that:   The staff member must serve at least 12 months of the probationary period. Previous service recognized towards the probationary period must have been full-time and continuous, have occurred immediately prior to the appointment, and involved a similar range of duties.    1.4. Accelerated confirmation  At the time of, or at any point following the interim probationary report, a head of department may make a case for early confirmation of the staff member concerned. The proposal must be based on performance and is subject to support by the Dean and approval by the Vice-Chancellor or two DVCs (one of which is the DVC responsible for academic staff matters).   1.5. Extended period of probation  A probationary period may be extended after due process; see detail below.    A reporting officer is appointed to manage the staff member's performance by way of a probation plan.   2.1. The Reporting Officer must be identified and will be responsible for establishing a probation plan and reviewing the staff member's progress on a regular basis. The Reporting Officer is:   The Head of Department or Director of the GSB (or where the Dean authorises this, the Dean's nominee) in respect of members of a department; The Dean of the faculty or CHED, in respect of a Head of Department;    2.2. The staff member must comply in a timely fashion with all reporting requirements of the process. Failure to comply may lead to disciplinary action and, in extreme cases, can itself constitute reason for failing to confirm the appointment.   2.3. The Reporting Officer must meet the new staff member, preferably within the first month of employment, to discuss and agree a probation plan which outlines individual goals and objectives and identifies developmental needs in line with the agreed expected performance for academic staff. The overall workload of staff on probation should be determined so that the targets agreed in the probation plan are achievable.   2.4. The probation plan should include a recommendation for participation on NAPP (New Academic Practitioners' Programme) and the ERP (Emerging Researcher Programme), where appropriate.   2.5. The Reporting Officer should mentor the new staff member or appoint a person to mentor the new staff member in order to gain an understanding of the university structure and systems, and to give advice and guidance on teaching and research practices.   2.6. Performance against the objectives should be reviewed formally every year with a one on one discussion between the individual and the Reporting Officer. If a staff member's conduct or performance gives cause for concern, the Reporting Officer must address this as soon as possible with the individual so that he or she is aware of the nature of the concern and the extent of the shortfall against the objectives and agreed expected performance for academic staff. Where performance is considered to be below the standard expected, the Reporting Officer must manage this through a written development plan.   2.7. As part of the interim and final reporting process the staff member must, on request, submit a self-performance review report which will form part of the report related to the agreed plan.    An interim performance report is submitted half way through the probationary period.   3.1. The Reporting Officer must submit a written interim performance report (HR176), half way through the probationary period (unless there are acceptable reasons for a delay), and makes one of the following findings and recommendations:   Performance against the probation plan is at or above the expected level and the probationary period should continue; or In exceptional circumstances, performance against the probation plan is above the expected level and the appointment should be confirmed; or Performance against the probation plan is not yet at the expected level and the probationary period should continue subject to a development plan; or Performance against the probation plan is not at the expected level, and continuation of the probationary period is unlikely to result in the staff member achieving this, and the appointment should be terminated.    3.2. If the interim performance report has not been signed off by the relevant delegated authorities within 20 months of the start date, the late submission needs to be escalated to the Dean and/or the Deputy Vice-Chancellor by the HR Department.   3.3. The Reporting Officer sends a copy of the interim performance report to the staff member who may submit a response in writing for inclusion with the report.    A final performance report is submitted at the end of the probationary period.   4.1. At least two months and up to six months before the end of the probationary period the Reporting Officer must submit a final performance report (HR176) and make one of the following findings and recommendations:   The conditions of the appointment have been met and the appointment should be confirmed; or The conditions of the appointment have not been met and the probationary period should be extended to give further time for the staff member to meet them; or The conditions of the appointment have not been met and an extension (or further extension) of probation is unlikely to result in the staff member meeting the objectives; and the appointment should be terminated.    4.2. The Reporting Officer sends a copy of the final performance report to the staff member who may submit a response in writing for inclusion with the report.    The interim and final performance reports are approved at executive level.   5.1. The Reporting Officer sends the performance report plus response from the staff member (if submitted) via the Dean for comment, to the DVC responsible for academic staff matters.   5.2. The Vice-Chancellor or two DVCs (one of which is the DVC responsible for academic staff matters) considers the interim or final performance report and,  Either decides on the outcome in the cases of a recommendation for,   continuation of the probationary period; or confirmation of the appointment; or extension of the probationary period.   Or refers it to a Committee of Review, in the case of a recommendation for termination of the appointment. The Committee of Review must make a final decision on the outcome.   5.3. HR must ensure that the relevant Dean and the Reporting Officer are notified of the decision, who in turn must notify the staff member.    At the end of the probationary period, three outcomes of probation are possible:   6.1. Confirmation of appointment  If the outcome is a confirmation of the appointment a letter of confirmation is drawn up by HR and sent to the staff member by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor responsible for academic affairs. The Reporting Officer meets with the staff member and determines the workload and objectives for the next period of assessment. At this stage, or before this stage, the staff member should have a full teaching and administrative load as required by the position, and be assessed against the full requirements of the academic position at the agreed expected level of performance.   6.2. Extension of the probationary period  If the outcome is to extend the probationary period, a new probation plan must be determined following discussion between the Reporting Officer and the staff member. A copy must be sent to the Dean and DVC responsible for academic staffing matters. The staff member may request the formation of a Committee of Review in accordance with the process outlined in section 7 below, which will then have the power to decide on any one of the outcomes outlined in 5.2. above.   6.3. Termination of appointment  If the outcome is that the staff member has failed to meet the standards expected during probation, a statement identifying the grounds for termination of the appointment must be sent to the staff member by the Dean of the Faculty concerned. At this stage a Committee of Review will be established. The function of the Committee of Review is to hear the Reporting Officer and the staff member and to make a decision on whether the appointment be terminated or not.    In the case of a termination a Committee of Review will hear the evidence and make a final decision. The Committee of Review process will be as follows:    7.1. The Committee of Review will be established in accordance with the agreed procedures. See Appendix A: Composition of Committee of Review.   7.2. The Vice-Chancellor nominates the Chair of the Committee of Review.   7.3. The Executive Director: HR or nominee services the Committee of Review process.   7.4. The Executive Director: HR or nominee informs the staff member in writing of -   the opportunity to make a written submission to the Committee; the right to appear before the Committee to state a case and the right to be accompanied by a trade union representative or any member of the University who can speak on the staff member's behalf; the right to request up to two other staff members to give input to the Committee, either in writing or orally.    7.5. All the necessary documentary evidence is compiled. See Appendix B: Evidence to be presented to the Committee of Review.   7.6. The Executive Director: HR or nominee provides the staff member with copies of all documentation before the Committee of Review. This must be done to give the staff member reasonable time to respond to the evidence.   7.7. The Committee of Review meets to consider all submitted evidence and documentation, must hear the staff member if he/she wishes to be heard and must hear the Reporting Officer. The quorum for the Committee of Review is three members.   7.8. The Committee of Review makes a final decision (in accordance with 6.1 - 6.3 above) and reports this to the Vice-Chancellor. The Executive Director: HR must convey the decision to the staff member in writing.   7.9. The Committee of Review must specify if the termination is with or without notice and, if the former, the period of notice. Failing this decision, the notice stipulated in the employment contract will apply.   7.10. At any time after the final decision is made by the Committee of Review, the Vice-Chancellor may suspend the staff member from his/her duties on full pay if in his judgement this is justified, and provided the staff member has been given an opportunity to make representations on the matter.    Opportunity to appeal    7.11. The decision made by Committee of Review is final and there is no opportunity for the staff member to appeal.

Study and research leave accrues at the rate of two months leave for every completed year of full-time service, with some variations for senior academics in leadership roles. Study and research leave may be taken for periods of up to 12 months at a time and, depending on the length of time taken, this ordinarily begins on 1 Jan, 1 July or 1 October. Study &amp; research leave will not normally be granted during probation, a period of notice or within 3 years of the completion of the previous leave period. Arrangements must be made with the HOD and Dean for a leave replacement. Leave replacements are funded from the department or faculty fund. Contact leave is study and research leave used for shorter periods (1 to 3 months). It may not be taken during term time, except with approval. Staff may be awarded a study and travel grant at the discretion of the DVC and may separately cash in whole months of leave credit in exchange for travel, subsistence or conference fees. Application for study &amp; research or contact leave must be submitted 3 months in advance. It must be supported by the HOD and Dean and approved by the relevant DVC. A leave report must be submitted within one month of the end of the leave period. The DVC may authorise previous service for study and research leave accumulation, whether at UCT or another institution. A gratuity in respect of study and research leave not taken may be paid on retirement. Should the staff member leave within a certain period after having taken study and research leave, a proportional refund must be paid to the University.       Introduction  Study and research leave may be granted to a staff member to enable a period of uninterrupted study and/or research that will be of benefit to the University and scholarship generally.  Study and research leave is a privilege not a right. The designated Deputy Vice-Chancellor has authority to grant, or withhold, study and research leave or contact leave.  Applicable to   Permanent full-time staff on academic conditions of service, including joint staff, who fulfil the standard requirements of teaching and learning, research and administration, unless where explicitly stated in the individual letter of contract. Teaching only academics. The Vice Chancellor, Deputy Vice Chancellors and Deans.   Not applicable to   Part-time academic staff (academic staff who work less than forty hours a week) Academic staff on research conditions of service Temporary and contract (T1, T2) academic staff (contracts of employment of less than five years)   Policy details   Study and research leave  Definition   1.1. Study and research leave may be granted to a staff member to enable him or her to devote himself or herself to a period of uninterrupted study and/or research of a kind that will be of benefit to the University and scholarship generally, and may comprise the following examples:  Conducting scholarly work and research that will result in an appropriate higher degree, required professional experience, publications or other scholarly outputs. study to improve teaching skills 'in a scholarly sense', subject to the submission of a clear motivation as to how he or she intends to apply the knowledge gained if he or she wishes to study teaching skills exclusively, the submission of evidence of scholarly endeavours in teaching which exceed the normal requirements in respect of teaching duties an indication of the forum where, and the methodology how, knowledge gained during the leave will be shared and communicated with peers     Eligibility    1.2. A full-time permanent member of staff on academic conditions of service who fulfils the standard requirements of teaching, learning and research may be granted study and research leave.    Accrual by academic staff    1.3. Study and research leave accrues at the rate of two months leave for every completed year of full-time service. This includes temporary service which has been recognised as probationary service, but excludes periods of study and research leave taken, periods converted to study grants and periods of special leave without pay in excess of one month. This accrual gives a staff member the opportunity to apply for a period of study and research leave.  1.4. Accrual by the Vice-Chancellor and the Deputy Vice-Chancellors is 1 month per year while Deans accrue 2 months per year. These study &amp; research and contact leave conditions are reviewed through the Remuneration Committee of Council, and clarified in individual letters of contract.  1.5. Deputy Deans and Heads of Department accrue an additional two weeks of study and research leave annually over and above the S&amp;R leave accrued as an academic. In special circumstances the maximum accrual can be increased by approval of the DVC; this will not affect the maximum amount used in the calculation of the gratuity on retirement. This amount is accrued in arrears and pro-rated for part of the year served as Deputy Dean or Head. The pro-ration is applied as follows:     Duration as DD/HOD Additional study and research leave   Less than six months None   Six to nine months as DD/HOD One week   Ten to twelve months as DD/HOD Two weeks     Note: Staff who serve as both Deputy Dean and Head of Department only accrue a total of an additional two weeks per annum (not 2 x two weeks).  1.6. Research staff (or staff on research conditions of service) do not accrue study and research leave. Where accrual of one month per annum exists as a result of previous conditions of service, such accrual will continue while the staff member remains employed in the same post.  1.7. Part-time staff do not accrue study and research leave. The DVC may, in exceptional circumstances, approve accrual of study and research leave. This must be clarified in the individual's contract of employment. Where accrual of one month per annum exists as a result of previous conditions of service, such accrual will continue while the staff member remains employed in the same post.  1.8. Leave credit may be accrued up to a maximum of sixteen months.    Periods of leave    1.9. Study and research leave may be granted for periods of six, nine or a maximum of twelve months, within the limits of the current credit of the applicant. Alternatively, one or two months may be granted for the specific purpose of completing a piece of writing.  1.10. Leave for periods of six and twelve months must ordinarily begin on 1 January or on 1 July, and leave for a period of nine months must ordinarily begin on 1 October. Applications for leave for periods of six, nine or twelve months which are to begin on other dates, must state why a departure from the ordinary dates is necessary.  1.11. Where leave begins in and/or includes January, the staff member may make arrangements with his or her head of department to take annual leave at another time in the year in question. Annual leave must be taken in the year it accrues; it may not be deferred. It thus follows that where a period of 12 months is taken over a calendar year, annual leave is not given.  1.12. Leave credit which is not utilised in any period of study and research leave may be carried forward towards leave to be taken on a subsequent occasion.    Probation    1.13. Study and research leave will not normally be granted to a staff member within the probationary period unless approved by the DVC and stated in the individuals' contract of employment.    Periods between leave    1.14. Study and research leave will not normally be granted to a staff member within three years of the completion of his or her last period of study and research leave. However, in the interests of the department, a member of staff who is eligible for twelve months' leave may be permitted to take two periods of six months' leave. The second period of six months should be taken within twelve months of the expiry of the first.    Arrangements during absence on leave    1.15. Study and research leave is granted only where the Head of Department, in consultation with the Dean, has proposed arrangements for the conduct of the department concerned during the staff member's absence.  1.16. Arrangements for the satisfactory discharge of the duties of a Dean while on study and research leave must be acceptable to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor to whom the Dean reports.    Contact leave Definition    2.1. Shorter periods of study and research leave which are taken as contact leave, is intended to enable a staff member to establish and maintain contact with colleagues pursuing common research interests, to collect material for research or to complete a piece of writing.    Period of Contact leave    2.2. A member of staff may be permitted to use his or her leave credit for study and research leave for short periods (three weeks to three months) of contact leave, such credit then being correspondingly reduced by the number of whole months rounded up. Contact leave is usually granted for one month but may be extended to up to a total of 3 months, provided that normally not more than one month is taken during term time. Under exceptional circumstances it may be possible for a staff member to take less than a month's contact leave. Less than three weeks' contact leave, however, is not granted. Absences shorter than three weeks on 'University Business' should be regarded as special leave.    Reduction of leave credit    2.3. Although staff members may take contact leave of varying lengths, leave credit is reduced in whole months only. Part of a month is rounded up.    Arrangements during term time    2.4. Before contact leave will be permitted during term time, an application must have the support of the Head of the Department who will have ensured that suitable arrangements have been made in respect of the teaching duties of the applicant.    Contact leave and special leave    2.5. Staff members will not normally be permitted to add contact leave onto a period of special leave.    Funding Grants to staff    3.1. Study and research leave and contact leave are granted with full pay and rights. 3.2. A member of staff who takes study and research leave may, at the discretion of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor designated by the Vice-Chancellor for the purpose, be awarded a study travel grant   subject to the submission and approval of a budget once only in respect of each entitlement to twelve months of leave of up to R 7 500 for travel anywhere outside South Africa of up to R 2 000 for travel within South Africa in addition to a grant from his or her leave credit (see below)  3.3. A member of staff who takes study and research leave or contact leave may also receive a grant towards the costs of travel, subsistence and conference/course fees from part of his or her leave credit. If he or she does so, the grant will be awarded as follows:   one month's encashment per two months' leave taken, up to a maximum of four months' encashment and his or her leave entitlement will be reduced by the period of actual leave taken and, in addition, the equivalent, in months, of the grant (that is, the amount of leave he or she has been allowed to 'cash in' as defined below)   3.4. The maximum number of months which can be 'cashed in' in any two successive years will be four months. This can be taken as 2+2, 1+3, 3+1, 0+4 or 4+0 months provided that the budget is supported by the Head of Department and Dean in each case and approved, in the context of the application as a whole, by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor designated by the Vice-Chancellor for the purpose.  3.5. When a staff member 'cashes in' a portion of his or her leave credit, the following conditions apply:   Only whole months of leave may be 'cashed in', except in the case of staff who are or have been Department Heads or Deputy Deans with the entitlement to accrue, and hence to 'cash in', periods of less than a month. The period 'cashed in' may not exceed the current credit available to the staff member. The period 'cashed in' must be subject to submission and approval of a budget. The sum of money (i.e. the value of a month of leave credit) made available to all staff (regardless of rank) for each month of leave which is 'cashed in', is determined by management from time to time. The period of actual leave, together with the months that have been 'cashed in' to obtain a grant, will be treated as the period of service during which study and research leave does not accrue.     Funds for leave replacements    3.6. Funds for the replacement of staff on study and research and contact leave are not provided by a central fund. The Dean has the discretion to make funding available from faculty budgets.    Applications, approvals and reporting Timing of application    4.1. A member of staff wishing to take study and research or contact leave should apply at least three months before he or she wishes to go on leave.    Documentation    4.2. A staff member who wishes to take study and research leave or contact leave must apply, using the prescribed form, through his or her Head of Department and Dean to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor designated by the Vice-Chancellor for the purpose. A proposed programme of study and research and an updated curriculum vitae must be submitted. In the event that the staff member wishes to study towards the completion of a higher degree, proof of registration and progress must be submitted.  4.3. If a staff member wishes to receive a study travel grant or a grant towards costs during study and research or contact leave, he or she must submit a detailed budget with his or her application.    Approval of leave    4.4. A member of staff may not proceed on study and research or contact leave unless leave has been supported by his or her Head of Department and Dean, and approved by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor designated by the Vice-Chancellor for the purpose.  4.5. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor has authority to grant, or withhold, study and research leave or contact leave. In exercising this authority he or she shall take into account the staff member's record of scholarly activity (in particular his or her teaching and/or research and publication record) in order to determine whether or not the granting of such leave is likely to serve the purposes for which it is intended.    Change of dates    4.6. A member of staff who wishes to change the dates or programme content of his or her approved study and research or contact leave, must seek approval for the changes as soon as these are known and before going on leave.    Leave reports    4.7. A member of staff is required to submit a report via his or her Head of Department to his or her Dean within one month of return from study and research or contact leave.  4.8. The Dean will submit this to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor designated by the Vice-Chancellor for this purpose, who considers it in relation to the programme approved on application.  4.9. Subsequent leave applications will not be considered unless a report on the previous period of study and research or contact leave has been submitted and approved.    Recognition of previous service for study and research leave Other institutions    5.1. Up to one half of any period of continuous service on the staff of another university, or other teaching or research institute, approved for the purpose by the University of Cape Town, may be recognised for study and research or contact leave purposes, if this service carried entitlement to leave of a similar kind and if the staff member was not granted this leave or pay in lieu of it. Proof of such entitlement must be submitted by the staff member concerned before credit is approved by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor designated by the Vice-Chancellor for the purpose.    UCT    5.2. When a temporary member of staff takes up a permanent appointment, and a portion of his or her temporary service is recognised for probationary purposes on the authority of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor responsible for academic affairs, the same period of temporary service will be recognised for study and research or contact leave purposes at the rate of two months per annum.    Joint staff    5.3. When a member of the joint staff (WCG or NHLS) is appointed to a University post, up to six months of his or her annual leave credit may be converted to a study and research leave credit. The annual leave credit, provided in working days, will be converted to months and rounded up.    Study &amp; research leave and retirement, resignation or death Approval    6.1. Study and research or contact leave may be granted at any stage up to retirement. It is a requirement that it must be for a period of uninterrupted study and research that will be of benefit to the University and scholarship generally. Each application will be considered on its merits.    Gratuity    6.2. A gratuity in respect of the balance of unutilised study and research leave standing to the credit of a staff member may be paid to him/her on retirement, or to the widow, widower or dependent children in the case of death. The gratuity is three-eighths of the monthly benefit amount (BA) multiplied by the number of months of outstanding study and research leave. This gratuity is restricted to a maximum amount of the monthly BA multiplied by 4.5.  6.3. The formula is ((Monthly COE amount x 70%) x 3/8) x no. of months outstanding S&amp;R leave.    Period of notice    6.4. Neither study and research nor contact leave may be included in the period of notice required when a staff member terminates his or her contract.    Refund of cost of employment and grants    6.5. If a staff member gives notice immediately after a period of leave of any kind (of which part was study and research or contact leave) and is permitted to curtail the prescribed period of notice, he or she shall, unless the Council determine otherwise, be required to refund the cost of employment for the period of his or her absence and any travel grant and other allowance he or she received in respect of the period of study and research.  6.6. Should a staff member leave the University within six months of a period of study and research leave of six months or less, or within twelve months of a period of study and research leave of more than six months, he or she must refund such part of the cost of employment, travel grant and other allowance as is proportionate.

"Honorary Professors and Honorary Associate Professors (below) | Honorary Research Associates and Affiliates | Honorary Lecturers and Senior Lecturers (principally in the Health Sciences Faculty) | Honorary Visiting Executives in Graduate School of Business (GSB)    Selection committee procedures for Honorary Professors and Honorary Associate Professors  Preamble   The University may appoint distinguished people who are in a position to contribute to its scholarship through involvement in teaching and/or research as Honorary Professors or as Honorary Associate Professors. These selection procedures provide for the nomination of candidates for appointment as Honorary Professors and for the consideration of each nomination by a Senate Selection Committee.   Policy on Honorary Professorships and Honorary Associate Professors and definitions:   Honorary appointments are of two kinds:   a person who is the head or a senior member of an institution closely associated with the University in one or more fields of its academic activity and with the teaching and research of members of the University; or a person who by virtue of his or her-  status in teaching and research; or achievement and distinction in professional activities would add materially and notably to the scholarship and prestige of the University as a whole     The privileges and rights of Honorary Professors are as determined by Council and Senate from time to time (See PC 04 2008).  Honorary Professors are not members of Senate.  Honorary Professorships are distinct from Visiting Professorships or Adjunct Professorships.  A person who retires from an Honorary Professorship after having served for ten or more years may be elected by Senate as an Emeritus Honorary Professor.  The period of appointment of an Honorary Professor appointed under   will be ex officio his or her holding the office by virtue of which he or she has been nominated or for as long as the institution concerned remains closely associated with UCT; or will be for a specified period, usually five years, which may be renewed on the recommendation of the standing selection committee for a further specified period.   Nomination process A proposal for an Honorary Professorship or Associate Professorship must be made must be made by a member of Senate supported by at least one other member of Senate using nomination form HR169.  Standing Selection Committee for Honorary Professorships  4.1 A standing selection committee appointed by Senate will meet twice each year to consider nominations of candidates for appointment as Honorary Professors.    4.2 The selection committee will consist of  The Vice-Chancellor and the Deputy Vice-Chancellors (ex officio) one of whom will chair the committee; Three professors per faculty appointed by Senate for a four-year term of office; The Dean of a Faculty where he or she is not chosen under (b), for those meetings of the Committee which consider a nomination for an appointment in his or her faculty.   Provided that a nominator or seconder of a candidate shall recuse himself or herself when his or her nomination is considered.

Exceptions are permitted and this policy provides for the exceptions.  Appointment without advertisement may be permitted where:   The incumbent is being considered for a contract renewal or permanent appointment; or The field has been recently canvassed and a strong appointable candidate has been identified; or A person has been identified with scarce skills for a specialised post; or External funding is linked to the appointment of a specific candidate; or The Vice-Chancellor has motivated for a strategic appointment.   The process involves three mandatory stages:   Motivation Approval Recommendation       Applicable to  Both PASS and academic staff in the following employment categories:   New permanent appointments. New contract appointments of more than 2 years (T2). Renewal of existing contracts for a further period when this will necessitate a change in conditions of service (i.e. when T2 conditions of service will apply regardless of the length of the renewal). Change in appointment from contract to permanent.   Not applicable to   Contracts of 2 years or less (T1).     Policy details   Appointment without advertisement may be allowed in the following cases:     1.1. The candidate has a proven track record in a contract post, and is now to be considered for:   a contract renewal (in the same or very similar position) for a further period, where a change in conditions of service is necessary, i.e. when T2 conditions of service will apply. a permanent position (the permanent position must be the same or very similar to the current contract position).   For all of the above, the candidate must have undergone a sufficiently rigorous process on the first appointment to the position, and if not, a detailed motivation must be provided.   1.2. The field has been recently canvassed and a selection committee identified a strong appointable candidate in a recent process that concluded within the last three months, where:   the selection committee at that stage made no appointment, or the selection committee at that stage found more than one appointable candidate and the second choice candidate is now to be considered for the same or very similar post.    1.3. The faculty/department has identified a candidate with scarce skills for a highly specialised post, where it believes that the advertising process would not yield a better candidate.   1.4. The faculty/department has received external funding for a project and the award is linked to the appointment of a specific candidate.   1.5. The Vice-Chancellor has motivated for a strategic appointment and the motivation has been supported by the Standing Review Committee appointed for this purpose. (The Standing Review Committee comprises the Executive Director Human Resources, a nominee of the Employment Equity Forum (EEF) and three of the five senior non-decanal professors who are not Deputy Vice-Chancellors).    A motivation is prepared and checked with the Transformation Committee of the faculty/department.   The motivation must be prepared and approved for the selection committee process to commence. The approval paths differ for academic and PASS positions according to Table 1.  Table 1: Motivation for an appointment without advertisement:     Motivation Academic PASS   Prepared by Head of Department Head of Department or Line Manager   Departmental recommendation Dean Dean or Executive Director   Approval Deputy Vice-Chancellor (DVC) Executive Director: HR (EDHR)   Also approved by the Vice-Chancellor if it is ... Professorial Payclass 13, peromnes 4 or 5     2.1. The Head of Department/Line Manager must seek local approval from the Dean/Executive Director (see Table 1), with a motivation detailing compliance with one of the eligibility categories in clause 1, prior to approaching the faculty/department's Transformation Committee (TC) to advise them of the intention to commence with the appointment process. The Chair of the faculty/department's TC must nominate an employment equity representative to serve on the selection committee.  2.2. If the proposed appointment would represent an employment equity appointment, and additional employment equity funding is to be applied for, the Head of Department/Line Manager (see Table 1) must apply to the Director of Transformation Services in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor alerting him/her of the possibility of an application for funding for the position.  2.3. The above motivation must be sent to the relevant HR Practitioner for circulation to the relevant staff body for information only.    The motivation is approved at executive level.   The following procedure applies when motivating for an appointment without advertisement. All documentation is to be accompanied by an HR203 form.  3.1. The Dean/Line Manager (see Table 1) must submit a written motivation to the DVC/EDHR, stating the eligibility category (in clause 1) of the proposed candidate and the reasons for not advertising, with a position description, the full curriculum vitae of the proposed candidate, the names and contact details of three referees, a report on the consultation with the TC and where applicable, a report on (possible) employment equity funding.  3.2. If the motivation is approved by the DVC/EDHR (see Table 1), he/she will authorise a selection committee to convene.  3.3. If the motivation is not approved, or the selection committee declines to support the proposed appointment, the post will be advertised.  3.4. If the motivation is made by the Vice-Chancellor for a strategic reason and the Standing Review Committee has supported the motivation, the DVC must ensure consultation with the relevant faculty/departmental TC and, where applicable, provide a report on (possible) employment equity funding before authorising the appointment of a selection committee to convene to consider the appointment without advertisement.    A selection committee makes a final recommendation.   4.1. The selection committee meets to consider the motivation, check referees' reports (if applicable) and interview the candidate (unless there are cogent reasons not to interview, which will require a full motivation to the selection committee Chair). In some instances, the selection committee may have a preliminary meeting to consider the motivation (prior to interview) if the Chair thinks this necessary.  4.2. If the selection committee does not approve the proposed appointment the motivation must be referred back to the proposer (Head of Department, Line Manager, or Vice-Chancellor), with a recommendation on the way forward.  4.3. The selection committee's recommendation, with the motivation, position description, curriculum vitae and appointment form HR100c, will be approved by the Dean or Executive Director. Final approval will be according to Table 2 below.

Procedures  The procedures below are to be followed when appointing Wardens and Assistant Wardens:    When a vacancy occurs, a request is sent to the Executive Director, Department of Student Affairs, via the Director: Student Housing &amp; Residence Life for approval to fill the vacancy.   The Director: Student Housing &amp; Residence Life (in the case of a Warden position) or the Manager: Residence Life (in the case of an Assistant Warden position) and the Chair of the College of Wardens approves the composition of a selection committee, which consists of:   Director: SH &amp; RL (Warden position) Manager: Residence Life (Assistant Warden position) Warden of the residence (Assistant Warden position) College of Wardens representative 3 student representatives (Subwarden, Head student, house committee member) Residence Facilities Officer or nominee EE Representative HR Practitioner    The selection process is managed by the Staff Recruitment Office. This office keeps all applications on file, arranges all meetings, and keeps all members of the selection committee informed.   Once a selection committee is approved, a search meeting is convened and the position is advertised.   Members of the selection committee are provided access to the applications (which are strictly confidential to the committee) by the Staff Recruitment Office. The applicants are graded in a preliminary manner by the grading sub-committee, which would include the EE representative and students. Members of the selection committee are expected to scrutinise all the applications, and make any recommendations to the grading sub-committee.   The selection committee meets to decide on a short-list of candidates. Referees' reports are then requested.   The shortlisted candidates are then invited to interact with a representative group of house members, selected by the House Committee. The Warden of the house or the College of Wardens representative is present at this meeting in an oversight capacity.   The selection committee meets to interview the short-listed candidates. It takes into account the applicants' background and work experience as reflected in their curricula vitae, the referees' reports, the selection committee interviews and the report from the sub-committee on the house meeting and security checks if so requested by the committee, before making a recommendation.   The delegated authority for the appointment is the Executive Director, Department of Student Affairs.

"Policy date: 10 December 2010 (with amendments via the Principal's Circular 21 January 2015)   Purpose and nature of adjunct appointments  The University will appoint as adjunct academic staff (Adjunct Professors, Adjunct Associate Professors, Adjunct Senior Lecturers and Adjunct Lecturers), people in employment or professional practice outside the University, who would add value to the work of the departments in which they are to be appointed because of the contribution they can make from their commercial, industrial, or professional experience and affiliations. The adjunct staff member must exhibit a set of scarce or extraordinary skills as a result of their professional standing and affiliations.  The responsibilities of each adjunct staff member must be decided on an individual basis, and set out in the letter of appointment. The title of adjunct is to give recognition to an individual's participation in teaching and/or research. (For example, someone who is associated with a specialised investment house who would teach a component of BCom(Hons) in Financial Analysis might be appointed as an Adjunct Professor with defined teaching responsibility. Equally, a senior in-house scientist at SASOL who had an active role in working with members of a Chemical Engineering research group might be appointed as an Adjunct Professor with defined research responsibilities.)  Adjunct positions are different from academic or honorary positions, in that the incumbents will not necessarily be required to meet the scholarly/research requirements in terms of qualification or research track record required for other academic or honorary staff appointments, but must possess a demonstrable set of scarce or extraordinary skills as a result of their professional standing and affiliations.  Note:   1.1 Adjunct staff will typically be appointed in the professional disciplines such as business science, law, accounting, psychology, health sciences, performing arts, and engineering. 1.2 The appointment of adjunct staff will be made to accommodate the needs and requirements of a discipline, department or faculty. Academic staff currently in the employ of the University may not be appointed as adjunct staff. 1.3 Joint staff (on UCT, NHLS or WCG conditions of service) are UCT staff members in their own right and therefore may not be appointed as adjunct staff. 1.4 Part-time medical sessional teaching staff (joint staff holding less than a five eighths appointment) may be appointed as adjunct staff.   Conditions of employment  2.1 The appointment is normally part-time. 2.2 Adjunct staff are appointed subject to the post-retirement policy and fixed-term employment contract policy. 2.3 The adjunct staff level (Adjunct Professor, Adjunct Associate Professor, Adjunct Senior Lecturer or Adjunct Lecturer) will be determined based on the person's level and professional standing in their commercial, industrial, or professional base. Normally a person at the top of his or her profession would be appointed as Adjunct Professor e.g. the leading silks may be appointed as Adjunct Professors in the Faculty of Law, the top ENT Specialists as a Adjunct Professors in the Faculty of Health Sciences and the like. [Faculties will develop internal guidelines for adjunct appointments to guide decisions on the appropriate level of appointment]. 2.4 Adjunct staff may assume responsibilities in teaching and/or research and associated administrative duties. These responsibilities must be clarified in the letter of appointment. Performance will be assessed against this set of responsibilities. It is envisaged that application of the academic performance management system will accommodate different sets of responsibilities and performance objectives. 2.5 Adjunct staff may be paid a salary or fee, the amount of which must be stipulated in the letter of appointment. 2.6 In appropriate cases in the Faculty of Health Sciences, an Adjunct Professor or Adjunct Associate Professor should also be made a member of the joint staff with the approval of the Provincial Department of Health. 2.7 Benefits are subject to the type of contract (e.g. as stipulated in the fixed-term employment contract policy) and must be clarified in the letter of appointment.   Title The title associated with the position is ""Adjunct Professor, Adjunct Associate Professor"" etc. The title of Professor, Associate Professor etc may be used as a title of address but may not be used as a title of the position. Therefore adjunct staff members must always refer to their position at and relationship with UCT as Adjunct Professor, Adjunct Associate Professor etc.  Rights and responsibilities  4.1 Adjunct staff will enjoy the usual staff library privileges. 4.2 As members of the academic staff, adjunct staff are members of the convocation. 4.3 Adjunct staff are generally not members of Faculty Boards or Senate unless individually appointed. 4.4 Adjunct staff may act as co-supervisors of higher degree candidates but may not be the primary supervisor, except with the permission of the DVC Research after motivation from the faculty. In such cases an internal co-supervisor would normally be appointed. 4.5 Eligibility to apply for e.g. URC funding will depend on the type of contact that the adjunct staff member holds (which in most cases will be governed by the fixed-term employment contract policy). 4.6 Adjunct staff may have signing powers on UCT funds where appropriate, and based on operational needs. 4.7 The HoD and Dean must manage associated space requirements when appointing adjunct staff.   Selection and appointment  5.1 The process for the recruitment, selection and appointment of adjunct staff lies within the faculty. 5.2 Authority for the approval of appointment of an Adjunct Lecturer, Adjunct Senior Lecturer and Adjunct Associate Professor lies with the Dean. Authority for the appointment of an Adjunct Professor lies with the Deputy Vice Chancellor (responsible for academic matters) on recommendation by the Dean. 5.3 A selection committee must be constituted by the Dean. The selection committee will technically be a committee of Senate. As a result the VC and DVCs will be ex officio members, but will not ordinarily attend. The composition is determined by the Dean, but must include the Head of Department, 3 members of Senate and an EE representative. 5.4 The Dean has discretion on whether or not the post is advertised. 5.5 A formal letter of appointment will be issued by HR when a completed take on form is received.

"(For staff on academic conditions of service)  General | Procedure | The Faculty Ad Hoc Committee (The FC) | The Performance Monitoring Meeting (PMM)   General  This procedure needs to be read in conjunction with ""Performance management processes for academic staff"".  Definitions  ""Under-performance"" is performance which is below the desired standard for the staff member's rank and for which increases in remuneration levels may be withheld. Under-performance which is not corrected once identified may become unsatisfactory performance in due course.  ""Unsatisfactory performance"" means performance below the level acceptable for continued employment at the rank at which the staff member is currently appointed, or in some instances, in any academic post.  The first objective of this procedure is to correct and/or improve under- or unsatisfactory performance. But because unsatisfactory performance may persist, the second objective is to provide for the termination of the employment contract when this happens.  This procedure is to be used in cases of under- or unsatisfactory performance. Misconduct is a separate issue and must be dealt with through the disciplinary procedure. Under- or unsatisfactory performance may be attributable to lack of appropriate skills, incomplete knowledge, lack of experience, and/or lack of commitment. It may or may not be capable of being remedied.  Procedure Where the Head of Department (HOD) believes that a staff member is failing to meet the agreed performance criteria, a formal performance assessment must be held, even if it is not a scheduled annual assessment.  If, in the performance assessment, the HOD finds one or more area/s of performance to be unacceptable then the HOD will report this to the Dean.  If the Dean does not concur with the HOD's assessment, the Dean will counsel the HOD and the staff member.  If the Dean considers that there is prima facie evidence of under- or unsatisfactory performance, the Dean will appoint a Faculty Ad Hoc Committee to consider the staff member's performance.  The Faculty Ad Hoc Committee (The FC)  Composition The committee will comprise of 3 members appointed by the Dean from a panel of staff appointed by the Faculty Board for this purpose. The committee shall elect a chair from its members.  The evaluation meeting The HOD will report on the performance of the staff member. The staff member will be given the opportunity to respond to the HOD's allegations of either under- or unsatisfactory performance at a meeting convened by the FC.  The staff member has the right to be assisted by a representative of his/her choice at the meeting/s of the FC as long as the representative is a UCT staff member. Should a staff member elect not to have a representative this must be recorded in the notes of the meeting made by the Chair of the FC.  After considering the evidence, the FC will give a decision on the performance assessment.  If the FC confirms the allegations of under- or unsatisfactory performance, the Committee must ask the HOD plus a nominated member of the FC to initiate a Performance Monitoring Meeting (PMM).  If the FC does not confirm the allegations of under- or unsatisfactory performance the FC will counsel the HOD and the staff member.    The Performance Monitoring Meeting (PMM) The number of PMMs is not prescribed by this procedure but rather depends on the circumstances of each case. The number of PMMs may be indicated by factors such as the degree of under- or unsatisfactory performance and the possible consequences for the University. The process described below suggests two meetings but this is an example. The number of meetings will not normally be fixed, but the number judged necessary will be decided as the process unfolds.   Preliminaries to the first PMM Where the FC concurs with the HOD's assessment of under- or unsatisfactory performance, the Chair of the FC shall inform the staff member that he/she is required to attend a meeting to discuss a Performance Improvement Plan. This meeting shall be held as soon as possible after the FC has completed a written assessment of the staff member's performance. Sufficient notice (at least 3 working days) shall be given to the staff member.  The written report of the FC will be given to the staff member to help him/her to plan for the first PMM.  The staff member shall be informed that he/she has the right to be assisted by a representative of his/her choice at this and all subsequent PMMs provided that the representative is a UCT staff member. Should a staff member elect not to have a representative this must be recorded in the notes of the meeting made by the HOD.  If the representative of the staff member's choice is not available and if sufficient notice of the meeting has been given, the staff member has the option of finding an alternative representative before the scheduled meeting or proceeding without a representative.  The first PMM: Performance Improvement Plan The purpose of the first PMM is to enable the FC's Nominee (FCN) and the HOD to put in place a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). The FCN and HOD are ultimately responsible for devising the PIP, but must consult the staff member before finalising this.  The necessary steps required to overcome the weaknesses identified in the FC's report should be discussed, and where possible agreed to. A PIP shall be drawn up by the FCN/HOD and the staff member for a specific course of action, and be documented. A copy of the PIP shall be given to the staff member.  A date for a follow-up PMM shall be set to review the staff member's performance. The period between meetings depends on the nature of the work performed, the period over which performance can be measured, the seriousness of the under- or unsatisfactory performance, and the amount of time and support judged necessary (anticipated) to rectify the under- or unsatisfactory performance. This could be as short as a few weeks or as long as three years.  Informal feedback between the formal reviews should take place. Where the staff member asks for additional formal or informal meetings (e.g. for extra help), these should be arranged unless the requests are unreasonable.  In the case of unsatisfactory performance, and where the FCN/HOD believes that the staff member may be unable and/or unwilling, in a reasonable period of time, to do what is necessary to improve to adequate levels of performance, the FCN/HOD shall indicate the possibility of the employment contract being terminated.  Where the FCN/HOD has warned that the employment contract could be terminated should there be insufficient improvement in performance, the FCN/HOD shall put this in writing to the staff member, indicating that if performance does not improve, the matter would be referred to a Committee of Review (COR).  The second PMM: Review of Performance Improvement Plan Regardless of whether performance has improved, remained the same or deteriorated, the follow-up meeting shall take place on the scheduled date, or within 3 weeks of the scheduled date if either staff member or the FCN/HOD has to change the prior arrangement.  A written review of progress against the PIP shall be completed by the FCN/HOD, and given to the staff member after discussion with him/her.  If performance has improved to an acceptable level, the Annual Review with the HOD and subsequent performance assessment by the HOD, will be used for further feedback. This would mark an end to the use of the Under- or Unsatisfactory Performance Procedure in this episode.  If performance has improved but has still not improved to an acceptable level, the FCN/HOD shall substantiate any remaining areas of under- or unsatisfactory performance and give the staff member an opportunity to respond. A date to assess performance again shall be set. Informal feedback between the formal meetings should take place. Where the staff member asks for additional formal or informal meetings (e.g. for extra help), these should be arranged unless the requests are unreasonable. Under performance which is not corrected, may become unsatisfactory performance in due course.  If the FCN/HOD finds that the staff member's performance has not improved to an acceptable level, and believes that despite being given an opportunity to do so, performance is unsatisfactory because:   the staff member is unwilling to do what is necessary to improve to adequate levels of performance; or the staff member is unable, or unable in a reasonable period of time, to do what is necessary to improve to adequate levels of performance; then the FCN/HOD shall ask the Vice Chancellor to establish a COR. The procedure for addressing unsatisfactory performance at the central level i.e. the procedure for a Committee of Review, will thereafter be followed.

"Performance management process | Performance Improvement Plan  Procedure to be followed where a staff member does not meet the position performance requirements and performance objectives  The objective of this procedure is to correct and/or improve performance. The procedure is a positive one and is not meant to be punitive. However, to accommodate the possibility that poor performance may not always be corrected, the procedure has to also cover the possible termination of the employment contract.   Performance management process   1.1. New staff need to be given a current position description and a clear understanding of objectives/tasks and standards of performance expected. The objective-setting exercise must be completed within weeks of a new staff member commencing duty. 1.2. All permanent staff, whatever their length of service, should have a discussion with their managers each year regarding objectives and tasks for the year. This is part of the Development Dialogue (DD) process agreed with the UCT Employees Union. 1.3. Where a manager believes during the performance review process that a staff member is failing to meet the position performance requirements based on the agreed and understood objectives a Performance Improvement Plan can be initiated. 1.4. If the staff member wishes to appeal against the assessment then this process is aligned with the principles of the UCT grievance procedure. 1.5. The staff member is to first discuss the issue with the immediate line manager and attempt resolution. If there is no satisfactory resolution then the staff member has recourse to the next management level. The immediate line manager and the HR Practitioner need to be informed by the staff member of this action.   Performance Improvement Plan  The number of Performance Improvement Plan meetings is not prescribed in this procedure but rather depends on the circumstances of each case. The number of meetings may be indicated by factors such as the degree of poor performance, the possible consequence for the University, etc. The process described below suggests three meetings but this is just a guide; one may have fewer or more meetings depending on the circumstances. 2.1. Preliminaries to the first Performance Improvement Plan meeting  2.1.1. Where a staff member does not meet the position performance requirements or the performance objectives the manager shall inform the staff member that he/she is required to attend a meeting to discuss a Performance Improvement Plan. It is desirable that this meeting be held as soon as possible after the review process. 2.1.2. A copy of the outcomes of the review process will be given to the staff member in order for him/her to plan for the Performance Improvement Plan meeting. Sufficient notice (at least 2 working days) shall be given to the staff member. 2.1.3. The staff member shall be informed that he/she has the right to be assisted by a representative of his/her choice at this and all subsequent review meetings while performance does not meet the performance requirements, provided the representative is a UCT staff member. Should a staff member elect not to have a representative, this should be recorded in the Performance Improvement Plan notes. 2.1.4. If the representative of the staff member's choice is not available and if sufficient notice of the Performance Improvement Plan meeting has been given, the staff member has the option of finding an alternative representative before the scheduled meeting or proceeding without a representative.   2.2. The first meeting: Performance Improvement Plan  2.2.1. Sections 1 to 4 of the Performance Improvement Plan form (HR170) must be discussed. The performance requirements that are expected must be clarified. Corrective measures must be discussed. These may include, if deemed necessary, additional on-the-job training, courses, reading, counselling etc. 2.2.2. A date for a follow-up meeting shall be set to review the staff member's performance. The period between meetings depends on the nature of the work performed, the period over which performance can be measured and the seriousness of the poor performance. Informal feedback between the formal reviews should take place. 2.2.3. The Performance Improvement Plan form must be completed. A copy shall be given to the staff member.   2.3. The second meeting: Review of Performance Improvement Plan  2.3.1. Regardless of whether performance has improved, remained the same or deteriorated, the follow-up meeting shall take place on the scheduled date, or within 3 weeks of the scheduled date, if either staff member or manager has to change the prior arrangement. 2.3.2. A form called Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Review shall be completed (HR171). 2.3.3. If performance has improved to an acceptable level the staff member will be given a copy of the completed form and thereafter, the progress reviews that are part of the general performance management system will be used for feedback. This would mark an end to the use of the procedure in this agreement. 2.3.4. If performance has not improved, however, the manager shall substantiate any remaining areas of unsatisfactory performance and give the staff member an opportunity to respond. If performance has not improved to an acceptable level, and depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet required performance standards, the manager may indicate the possibility of the employment relationship being reviewed with the possibility of the contract being terminated if performance does not improve by the next meeting. A date to review performance again shall be set. Informal feedback between the formal reviews should take place. 2.3.5. After the meeting, the staff member shall be given a copy of the completed Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Review form (HR171). 2.3.6. Where, in 2.3.4 management has indicated that the employment contract could be terminated should there be no improvement in performance by the next meeting, a letter to this effect shall also be given to the staff member.   2.4. The third meeting  2.4.1. Regardless of whether performance has improved, remained the same or deteriorated, the follow-up meeting shall take place on the scheduled date, or within 3 weeks of the scheduled date. 2.4.2. If the manager believes that the staff member's performance has not improved, a senior manager (e.g. HOD or section head) must chair the meeting. A member of the Human Resources Department may also be invited to attend. 2.4.3. Another Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Review form must be completed (HR171). 2.4.4. If the Chair finds that performance has improved to an acceptable level, this would mark the end to the use of the procedure in this agreement. Future feedback would follow the procedure detailed in the performance management agreement. 2.4.5. If, however, the Chair finds that the staff member has not achieved the required standard of performance, the Chair may decide to hold further review meetings or to terminate the employment relationship. The contractual period of notice, or payment in lieu of this notice, shall be honoured in the event of dismissal. 2.4.6. Formal notice of the outcome of the review meeting shall be given to the staff member by the Chair. The Chair shall keep a full record of the third review meeting and shall make it available to the staff member, or his/her representative, on request.   2.5. Alternatives to terminating the employment contract  2.5.1. In special circumstances, i.e. on the request of the Chair of the review meeting described in 2.4, attempts shall be made where appropriate to redeploy/demote the staff member to a vacancy at a lower level of responsibility within the university. 2.5.2. Where the staff member concerned rejects a proffered transfer and/or demotion, termination of the employment relationship shall follow. 2.5.3. Where the staff member accepts a demotion, a new contract shall be entered into at the payclass of the new post. The staff member's salary, where higher than the standard package of the new payclass, shall be brought in line immediately with the new payclass standard package.   2.6. Appeal  2.6.1. A staff member has the right, either personally or through his/her representative, to appeal against any decision to terminate his/her employment contract on the basis of poor performance. 2.6.2. The basis for the appeal must be stated. 2.6.3. The appeal should be made in writing to the Registrar, via the Employee Relations Section of the Human Resources Department, within 7 (seven) working days of the dismissal. The Registrar, or Registrar's nominee, shall decide the appeal. If the Registrar or Registrar's nominee considers it necessary, he/she shall convene an appeal hearing to hear oral evidence within 14 (fourteen) days of receipt of the appeal. 2.6.4. The Registrar or the Registrar's nominee may accept a notice of appeal lodged after the expiry of the said time limits. 2.6.5. A decision on the appeal shall be given within 7 (seven) working days of receipt of the appeal if no hearing is called, or within 7 (seven) working days of the conclusion of the appeal hearing. This decision will be given as soon as possible thereafter in writing. This decision shall be final and shall indicate the end of the procedure for addressing unsatisfactory performance.

"General | Procedure for an individual grievance | Procedure for a group grievance | Attendance at grievance hearings (group and individual) procedure | Relation between the grievance and disciplinary procedures   General   A grievance is any dissatisfaction and/or feeling of injustice in connection with a staff member's work and/or employment situation (other than conditions of service and salary range, and other than arising from disciplinary action) which is brought to the attention of management. The University of Cape Town (hereinafter ""the University"") and the National Education, Health, and Allied Workers Union (hereinafter ""the Union"") on the one hand, and the University and the UCT Employees Union (hereinafter ""the UCTEU"") on the other hand, agree bilaterally in each case that it is in their mutual interest to observe a grievance procedure by which all grievances can be considered and resolved. To this end the grievance procedure below is agreed. No staff member shall be victimised as a result of his/her raising a grievance. The intention of the University and the Union/UCTEU is that grievances shall be resolved at the earliest stage possible and as quickly as possible. The time periods specified below are maximum time periods, to be utilised to the full only where the complexity of the grievance requires the full use thereof. Where it is impracticable to address a grievance within the time limit set out in the procedure, an extension can be agreed between the staff member lodging the grievance and the supervisor/manager. Such an extension must be recorded in writing and signed by both parties. All time periods refer to full working days. ""Day"" means, for the purposes of determining time periods in this agreement, any day except Saturdays, Sundays and University holidays. A member of staff with a grievance may be assisted throughout the procedure by a staff member representative, shop steward (in the case of the Union) or another UCT staff member acting as his/her representative. Any shop steward with a grievance may be represented by an official of the Union/UCTEU.  The University shall allow a reasonable amount of time off work to a staff member with a grievance and his/her representative for tasks related to the resolution of the grievances (preparation time as well as attendance at grievance hearings). Prior approval for time off work must be obtained from the relevant supervisor(s).   The University and the Union/UCTEU recognise the difference between an individual grievance and a group (or collective) grievance, and procedures for each are detailed below. Where a staff member's (or group of staff members') grievance arises from racism, racial discrimination or racial harassment, he/she/they may elect to follow either the procedures detailed below, or the procedure outlined in the University policy on racism and racial harassment. Where a grievance arises out of sexism, gender discrimination or sexual harassment, the staff member/s may elect to follow either the procedures detailed below, or the procedure outlined in the policy and procedure on sexual harassment.   Procedure for an individual grievance  Stage one (informal stage) If a member of staff wishes to raise a grievance he/she shall approach his/her immediate line manager at which point an attempt must be made to resolve the grievance at this level. Should the grievance relate to the actions of the immediate line manager, the staff member should approach their departmental/faculty human resources practitioner who will facilitate an attempt to seek a resolution to the matter. If the staff member so wishes, he/she may obtain the assistance of a representative. Two days will be allowed for this stage.  Stage two (formal stage) If the grievance has not been resolved informally, the staff member may take the grievance further and formalise the process by now completing the grievance form. The staff member shall send the form to his/her senior, and a copy to the Employee Relations section of the Human Resources Department within three days of the end of stage one.  Within two days of receipt of the grievance form, a meeting of the following people will be convened by the senior to whom the form was sent   a chairperson (who shall be a supervisor/manager more senior than the immediate senior) the staff member lodging the grievance the staff member's representative (if requested by the staff member) the staff member's immediate senior.   The chairperson, may, if he/she deems it appropriate, suggest to the parties to the grievance to attempt to resolve the grievance through mediation in accordance with the University's Mediation policy. Mediation may also be suggested by any of the parties to the grievance at any stage of the grievance process. No party is under any obligation to accept an invitation to mediation, and no negative inference or consequences may incur from such refusal. An attempt at resolving the issues through mediation does not cancel the grievance unless the employee who lodged the grievance agrees that it has been resolved and the terms of the agreement has been reduced to writing. In the event that the mediation process is unable to resolve the issues that gave rise to the grievance, the grievance procedure will recommence at the stage it was put on hold to attempt resolution through mediation.  If the staff member's representative is a Union/UCTEU staff member representative, a message for the representative may be left at the Union office (3131) / UCTEU office (2380). From the date of this meeting, up to three days will be allowed for a resolution to be achieved before proceeding to the next stage. The chairperson's decision will signify the end of stage two. The chairperson will complete the relevant section of the grievance form and return the original form to the staff member who submitted it, together with his/her report on the grievance and his/her proposal regarding resolving the grievance.  Stage three In the three days following the end of stage two, should the staff member wish to take the grievance further, he/she should send the grievance form to the senior of the chairperson at stage two, and a copy to the Employee Relations section. Within three days of the receipt of the grievance form a meeting of the following people will be convened by the supervisor/manager to whom the form was sent:   the chairperson (a manager senior to the chairperson in stage two. Guideline level: HOD) the staff member lodging the grievance the staff member's representative (if requested by the staff member) the full-time Union representative (if requested by the staff member) the staff member's senior (if presence required) a representative from the Employee Relations section any other staff member(s) the chairperson wishes to invite in order to facilitate the resolution of the grievance, subject to the consent of the staff member with the grievance.   From the date of this meeting, up to three days will be allowed for a resolution to be achieved before proceeding to the next stage.  The chairperson's decision will signify the end of stage three. The chairperson will complete the relevant section of the grievance form and return the original form to the staff member who submitted it, together with his/her report on the grievance and his/her proposal regarding resolving the grievance.  Stage four In the three days following the end of stage three, should the staff member wish to take the grievance further, he/she should send the grievance form to the Registrar, and a copy to the Employee Relations section. The Registrar (or the Registrar's nominee) will review the case. If the Registrar appoints a nominee, the staff member with the grievance and his/her representative (if applicable) will be advised accordingly. If deemed necessary by the Registrar (or nominee) to establish further facts about the case, a meeting will be convened within five days of receipt of the grievance form. The meeting will consist of:   the chairperson (the Registrar or the Registrar's nominee) the staff member lodging the grievance the staff member's representative (if requested by the staff member) the full-time Union/UCTEU representative (if requested by the staff member) and/or an external Union official (if requested by the staff member) the staff member's immediate senior (if presence required) a representative from the Employee Relations section any other staff member(s) the chairperson wishes to invite in order to facilitate the resolution of the grievance (subject to the consent of the staff member with the grievance)   From the date of this meeting five days will be allowed for a resolution to be achieved. The chairperson's decision will signify the end of the grievance procedure. The chairperson will complete the relevant section of the grievance form and return the original form to the staff member who submitted it, together with his/her report on the grievance and his/her proposal regarding resolving the grievance. If the Union/UCTEU believes that circumstances warrant it, they may hereafter raise the issue in terms of the dispute procedure.    Procedure for a group grievance  Where it is evident that two or more staff members have the same grievance, the staff members may elect to have the grievance dealt with as one. The group will elect spokespersons who will act for the group. If the group consists of  eight or less staff members, they may elect one spokesperson. nine to 25 staff members, they may elect two spokespersons. 26 or more staff members they may elect three spokespersons.   One of the following procedures may be chosen:  Where it is evident that two or more staff members in the same section within the same department have the same grievance, the grievance may be addressed via the grievance procedure detailed in clause 2 of this agreement. Alternatively, the procedure below may be followed. Where it is evident that two or more staff members have the same grievance but the staff members concerned do not come from the same section, the grievance may be taken, as an agenda item, to the consultative meeting. Notwithstanding the procedure in 3c i or 3c ii, in the case of a group grievance, a meeting may be convened within three days of line management and the Employee Relations section being sent a grievance form. This meeting would comprise the elected spokesperson(s) (as defined in 3b) and their representative (if requested by the staff members), and management representatives.   If the Union/UCTEU believes circumstances warrant it, the Union/UCTEU may hereafter raise the issue in terms of the dispute procedure.   Attendance at grievance hearings (group and individual) procedure A member of staff who is the subject of the grievance shall not be required to attend a grievance hearing with all parties present against his/her will. In cases where the aggrieved party and the person who is the subject of the grievance are in a close working relationship (either in a line relation or as part of the same team) the chairperson of the grievance meeting may ask both parties to be present with the aim of resolving the problem/conflict. Where the staff member who is the subject of the grievance wishes to respond separately, such meetings will be arranged. Both parties shall be required to be present at a follow-up meeting at which the chairperson shall table his/her proposed resolution of the matter. Both parties may agree to discuss the proposed resolution at that meeting, but this is not a requirement.     Relation between the grievance and disciplinary procedures Grievances are often the result of a misunderstanding between two or more parties and misconduct is not necessarily involved. Should, however, a grievance be brought to the attention of management and, after investigation, management is satisfied that there is evidence of misconduct on the part of the staff member who is the subject of the grievance, the matter shall be handled in terms of the disciplinary procedure. The staff member who lodged the grievance may be asked to be a witness at the disciplinary enquiry. The decision to invoke the disciplinary procedure shall mark the end of the grievance procedure.

"Recognition and procedural agreement between the University and the UCT Employees Union   The University has entered into a recognition and procedural agreement with the UCT Employees Union whereby the University recognises the association as the collective bargaining agent in those payclasses where it has majority membership. (The full text of the agreement is available from the employee relations section, Human Resources Department.) Representation by the UCT Employees Union comprises the right to negotiate and conclude agreements on behalf of its members on issues such as salary, conditions of service and various procedures. The University accepts that the Employees Union may represent any of its members in respect of discipline and grievances, whether or not such a member is employed in the recognised bargaining unit. UCT Employees Union members are entitled to elect representatives in terms of the Union's constitution.  Union members are permitted up to 30 minutes per year during working hours to elect representatives for affiliated associations, and one hour per year during working hours to attend the annual general meeting of the union. Representatives are permitted five working days special leave per annum (to a collective maximum of 110 days) for training purposes, subject to the needs of the department in which they are employed and the approval of the Executive Director, Human Resources. Representatives are permitted to attend to their duties as representatives during working hours, within reason. For example, in attendance to matters relating to the disciplinary and grievance procedures. Representatives are permitted two hours per month to prepare for union executive monthly meetings (referred to in 5 below). A union representative is allowed one working day per week on general association business, provided that no one representative is selected for more than two days per month.   Monthly consultative meetings are held between (no more than ten) management representatives and a committee of (no more than ten) union representatives. The University and the union have agreed that the resolution of disputes be through negotiation and dialogue, in terms of the following procedures.  A declaration of dispute by the aggrieved party will set out the nature of the dispute and the proposed solution. Within five days of receipt of the declaration of dispute, the parties shall convene a meeting of the negotiatory committee in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should the dispute remain unresolved, a mediator chosen by both parties will confer with both parties in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If mediation fails to resolve the dispute, either party may exercise its right to take such legitimate industrial action as it may deem necessary. No strike action will take place unless 50% + 1 of staff within the bargaining unit have voted, by secret ballot, in favour of a strike. The union must give the University 72 hours written notice of the commencement of industrial action.   The University allows the union the use of University facilities and reasonable access to information that is relevant to the fulfilment of the association's aims and objectives.

"Introduction | Freedom of association | Organisational rights | Collective bargaining | Determining union membership numbers | Channels of communication | Disputes | Industrial action | Duration of agreement and termination | Amendments | Addendum  Recognition and procedural agreement between the University of Cape Town (""UCT"") and National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (""the union"")   Introduction   1.1 The purpose of this agreement is to formalise and regulate the relationship between the parties for their mutual benefit and goodwill. The maintenance of a harmonious working relationship is based on mutual respect in the workplace. This requires co-operation and good faith on the part of all the parties for the economic and social wellbeing of the parties. 1.2 The parties recognise that while there may be differences of opinion, they shall wherever possible attempt to reconcile such differences taking cognizance of the interests of all the parties. 1.3 The parties agree that the union has the right to conduct its own affairs in accordance with its constitution, subject to any legal constraints imposed by law or in terms of this agreement, provided that this does not result in any unlawful disruption to the business of UCT. 1.4 UCT is committed to treating unions consistently. This means that it should work towards a single set of organizational rights for unions who are recognized, subject to reasonable differences that may be justified by the history of the workplace and the number of union members in different bargaining units. Existing recognition agreements with previously recognized unions will be reviewed with this in mind.   Freedom of association Every member of UCT staff is free to choose whether to join any trade union of her or his choice.  Organisational rights  3.1 Qualifying criteria to enjoy organisational rights  3.1.1 The organizational rights set out below will be offered to –  3.1.1.1 any union that has at least 300 members employed by UCT; and 3.1.1.2 any other union that is recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.     3.2 Access  3.2.1 A recognized union will have access to UCT’s premises for the purposes of recruiting members, communicating with members or otherwise to serve the interests of members on request. 3.2.2 General meetings with members may be held on the premises of UCT, subject to UCT rules regarding conduct of meetings being applicable at all times. 3.2.3 Officials and office bearers of recognized unions will be allowed to have access to the campus -  3.2.3.1 to meet members during tea breaks, lunch hours, or outside normal working hours or, where reasonably required, during working hours subject to prior permission having been granted; 3.2.3.2 in any university building if the union has sought prior approval through the appropriate channels.   3.2.4 The names and contact details of union officials and office bearers who seek access to the campus must have been provided in advance in writing to the employee relations office.   3.3 Union meetings and facilities  3.3.1 A recognized union may use specific venues (lecture theatres, halls, and seminar rooms) for union meetings if this has been approved by the UCT bookings team directly (as a first option), alternatively through the employee relations office. 3.3.2 Union meetings or events must take place outside of working hours only, and must not interfere with or disrupt UCT’s operations and productivity, subject to 3.3.3. 3.3.3 A recognized union may hold -  3.3.3.1 a general meeting of members once a month, held during lunch time or outside working hours (either prior to the commencement of a shift or at the end of a shift) and at a place agreed upon. Provided that this does not unreasonably interfere with operations, union members may be given reasonable time off before or after the meeting to enable them to get to the meeting. The parties will monitor the effect of this agreement (on both the union and its members and on UCT’s operations). In exceptional circumstances and with express prior agreement of UCT management, report back meetings may take place during working hours, 3.3.3.2 an AGM once a year, which includes two hours during normal working time; and 3.3.3.3 in addition to the general meeting of members in 3.3.3.1, feedback meetings with members after meetings of the consultative forum or collective bargaining, outside working hours.   3.3.4 A recognized union may use the following additional UCT facilities –  3.3.4.1 printing facilities, at standard cost, and subject to any applicable internal rules and regulations; 3.3.4.2 the internal post delivery system; 3.3.4.3 departmental notice-boards, subject to the availability of space and the usual rules and procedures applicable from time to time, including any code of conduct regulating the content of notices, and any reasonable direction of heads of department responsible for relevant notice boards.   3.3.5 A union recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.1.1 will, if it has at least 500 UCT members, be given access to an office with telephone and computer email facility, at a cost proportional to the rate charged to other university based organisations for similar use or access. A union recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.1.1 with fewer than 500 UCT members will be given access to a shared office. 3.3.6 Access to facilities in terms of these provisions subject to such reasonable budget and cost limits as may be set between the parties from time to time.   3.4 Stop orders  3.4.1 UCT will deduct union membership subscriptions from the remuneration of all members who submit signed stop order forms. 3.4.2 Deductions for stop order forms delivered on or before the 3rd day of every month will ordinarily commence on the next pay date. 3.4.3 UCT will provide each recognised union with a list of names of employees for whom deductions have been made for that union together with the total number of membership fees deducted, on or before the 10th day of the month following the month for which the deductions were made. 3.4.4 UCT will stop deducting membership subscriptions from -  3.4.4.1 any union member who has given UCT one (1) month’s written notice to stop the deductions; 3.4.4.2 any union member who ceases to be employed by UCT; (in the case of a fixed term employee whose contract of employment is extended for a further period, the union must inform the relevant administrator in the payroll office - as specified by UCT from time-to-time - of the member’s new commencement date, failing which deductions for union membership subscriptions for that member will terminate); and 3.4.4.3 any union member who ceases to be a member of the union for any reason.   3.4.5 UCT will deduct membership fees for one recognised union only, unless the employee confirms in writing that she or he wishes to pay membership subscriptions to more than one recognised union and in so doing specifies one primary union for the purpose of counting union membership numbers to determine representivity for shop stewards and bargaining rights. 3.4.6 UCT will not be responsible for the collection of any subscriptions which are in arrears, unless UCT has acted in breach of its obligations under this agreement.   3.5 Shopstewards  Number and election of Shopstewards 3.5.1 A recognised union will be entitled to 2 shopstewards for up to 100 members, plus 1 shopsteward for each additional 50 members up to a maximum of 10 shopstewards. If the union has more than 500 members, it will be entitled to 10 shopstewards for the first 500 members, plus 1 shopsteward for every additional 200 members, to a maximum of 12 shopstewards. 3.5.2 The number of shopstewards will be determined for one year at a time on the basis of the number of members as at the annual date for determining membership numbers, referred to in clause 5. 3.5.3 Shopstewards must be elected by the members who are employees of UCT following the terms of the union’s Constitution and the LRA. The union must provide UCT with at least seven (7) days’ written notice of its intention to hold elections, and must notify UCT within seven (7) days of the election of the names of the elected shopstewards. Time off for Shopstewards 3.5.4 Shopstewards will be permitted up to 2 hours a month to meet during working hours to prepare for consultative meetings referred to in clause 4.4. These meetings must be arranged in consultation with line managers. 3.5.5 Shopstewards will be given reasonable time off for the purpose of performing their functions in the workplace (including meeting with members of management or representing members in internal processes) but will only be permitted to leave workstations during work hours, operations permitting, with the permission of their line managers, which must not be unreasonably withheld. The parties recognise that the role of shopsteward is not a full time role, and shopstewards remain obliged to perform their normal roles as employees. Where time off unreasonably affects a shopsteward’s ability to perform his or her normal role, UCT will raise this with the union, and the parties will make every reasonable effort to resolve the situation. 3.5.6 Time off for shopstewards is subject to the following further provisions:  3.5.6.1 Time off requests should be sent to the ER office in writing at least 3 working days before the requested time off, subject to the union having received sufficient notice of the meeting. Where this is not reasonably possible, the request should be sent as soon as possible after the shopsteward is made aware of the meeting. 3.5.6.2 Shopstewards are, unless otherwise agreed with supervisors, required wherever reasonably possible to return to work following the meetings or processes for which the time off has been given, but are then required to complete the remainder of their shift only, and are not required to work additional hours to make up for the time off. Shopstewards will ordinarily be allowed 30 minutes to return to their workstation. 3.5.6.3 If a shopsteward attends to union business, including attending meetings with management, during an off day or during hours when he or she is not on duty, this will not be considered to be time at work, and the shopsteward will, save in exceptional circumstances, not become entitled to additional time off work.   3.5.7 In addition, shopstewards are entitled to the following paid time off to receive training –  3.5.7.1 1 day for once-off basic training on the role and responsibilities of a shopsteward and the terms of recognition at UCT; 3.5.7.2 10 days per year per shopsteward, to a collective maximum of 50 days for shopstewards of one union, to attend regular training programmes; and   3.5.8 An employee who is also an office bearer in a union recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.1.1 is entitled to 15 days paid time off per year to attend to union business, including any training. This includes and is not in addition to the 10 days referred to in 3.5.7.2 if the office bearer is also a shopsteward. 3.5.9 Time off for training will be subject to the following further provisions –  3.5.9.1 The training must be approved by the Executive Director: Human Resources or nominee. Approval will take into account the operational needs of the department where each shopsteward works.

Approval of such leave shall not be unreasonably withheld. 3.5.9.4 UCT will, subject to availability, make facilities and members of its employee relations team available whenever possible at the request of the union for training programmes for shopstewards. 3.5.9.5 The chairperson of the shop stewards council of a union with at least 500 UCT members that is recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.1.1 shall be allowed up to one working day per week to conduct general Union business. The day selected shall be determined in consultation with the head of department concerned. The chairperson may delegate this right to another shop steward, provided that adequate notice is given to the department concerned. Should the work-related needs of the University require it, the Union must re-schedule the day, unless it can show good cause why it cannot do so.   Functions of Shopstewards 3.5.10 The functions of shopstewards are -  3.5.10.1 to assist and represent members in grievance procedures, disciplinary proceedings or other similar internal processes; 3.5.10.2 to monitor the University’s compliance with workplace related provisions of the LRA, any law regulating the terms and conditions of employment and any collective agreement binding on the University, and to report any alleged contraventions of these provisions; 3.5.10.3 if chosen by the union for this purpose, to participate in regular consultation or negotiation meetings with UCT’s management.   3.5.11 Shopstewards and UCT managers must endeavour to establish and maintain good relations between the members, the union and UCT management. 3.5.12 Shopstewards are not entitled to interfere with any lawful and legitimate instructions given by line managers or with the performance by employees of their duties. Shopstewards are, however, not prevented from giving advice to members. 3.5.13 Attendance at meetings with UCT representatives, CCMA appearance, grievances, and disciplinary inquiries will be limited to one or two shopstewards, with additional shopstewards present only where reasonably required for the particular purpose, as agreed from time to time, taking into account the role and purpose of any full time shopsteward where applicable. 3.5.14 Any reasonable action taken by a shopsteward in good faith in the course of her or his duties as shopsteward will not affect her or his employment by UCT, but shopstewards remain subject to the usual rules and procedures governing employees, including disciplinary rules and procedures, and the parties must comply with any code of conduct for shopstewards in place from time to time. Breach of code of conduct and termination of office of shopsteward 3.5.15 In the event of any serious breach of any applicable code of conduct for shopstewards, UCT may, after consultation with the union concerning the reasons for this, and on written notice to the union, vary, limit or withdraw recognition of a shopsteward. Any dispute over any such notice may be resolved using the disputes procedure in clause 7. 3.5.16 A shopsteward will cease to hold office and will no longer be recognised if she or he:  3.5.16.1 resigns as shopsteward; 3.5.16.2 commits a serious breach of this agreement or any code of conduct for shopstewards after a fair process has been followed; 3.5.16.3 ceases to be an employee of UCT; 3.5.16.4 ceases to be a member of the union; or 3.5.16.5 reaches the end of the term of office as shopsteward.     3.6 Full time shopstewards/ union administrators:  3.6.1 A union with at least 500 UCT members that is recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.1.1 will receive financial support from the university in an amount equivalent to the cost of salary of a pay class 7 employee to assist the union to employ a full time shopsteward or administrator. 3.6.2 The financial support may be used only to support the effective functioning of the union at UCT, and for no other purpose.     Collective bargaining  4.1 Qualifying criteria for bargaining rights  4.1.1 A union will be recognized for collective bargaining if it represents, either by itself or acting jointly with one or more other unions in the bargaining unit, 50% +1 of the total number of employees in the bargaining unit. 4.1.2 Where unions act jointly for the purpose of collective bargaining –  4.1.2.1 bargaining will be conducted in a single negotiating forum with all unions recognized in that bargaining unit, and not separately with each union; 4.1.2.2 the unions must advise UCT in writing of their decision to act jointly; and 4.1.2.3 the unions must inform UCT of the number of representatives of each union who will be represented in the negotiating forum, which must be in proportion to the number of members that each union has in the bargaining unit.   4.1.3 Ordinarily, a bargaining committee will comprise no more than 5 union representatives and five management representatives. Where unions act jointly for the purposes of collective bargaining, they may propose to increase this number if this is reasonably necessary to permit equitable representation, but only to that extent.   4.2 Bargaining unit  4.2.1 There will be two bargaining units for PASS staff, one each for:  4.2.1.1 PASS staff in payclasses 1 to 6 (in the case of payclass 6, in respect of members of the recognized unions only); and 4.2.1.2 PASS staff in payclasses 6 to 12.   4.2.2 The composition of the bargaining units will be reviewed during August 2018.   4.3 Bargaining cycle Bargaining will take place annually, unless otherwise agreed.  4.4 Consultative meetings UCT will schedule a consultative meeting for each bargaining unit each month, and a joint consultative meeting with all unions recognised for collective bargaining once a quarter.  4.5 Conduct in consultation and collective bargaining  4.5.1 The University and the unions, and the negotiators appointed to represent them, commit themselves to consulting and bargaining in good faith and with mutual respect. 4.5.2 The parties agree that disclosure of information is essential for a union to effectively engage in consultation and collective bargaining. All relevant information will be disclosed to the unions within a reasonable time on request, and subject to confidentiality and the provisions of section 16 of the LRA. 4.5.3 UCT and the union will ensure that they are familiar with and commit themselves to the principles and requirements set out in any applicable Code of Good Practice as amended from time to time.     Determining union membership numbers  5.1 Union membership numbers for all recognised unions will be disclosed to all recognised unions on a monthly basis. 5.2 The numbers of union members across UCT as a whole and in the separate bargaining units will be determined annually with effect from 31 July for the purpose of determining numbers of shopstewards and other recognition rights in terms of this agreement. 5.3 Recognition rights in terms of this agreement will be reviewed in August 2018.   Channels of communication  6.1 If the union becomes aware of a concern which it requires UCT to investigate or address and which falls outside a process regulated by a policy in place from time to time, the union will, unless not reasonably practicable, first raise the concern with the HR practitioner responsible for the department in which the concern has arisen. The HR practitioner will engage with the union and the management team to identify and (where possible) address the concern. 6.2 If the union is not satisfied that the concern has been addressed, it may escalate the matter to the ER Manager. The ER Manager will then engage with inter alia the union and the relevant HR practitioner to assess what further steps, if any, can be taken to address the concern of the union. The ER Manager (or someone delegated by him or her) will finalise the matter with the union. 6.3 All parties agree to engage in the above process in good faith and with a view to resolving the cause of concern. 6.4 The above process will be a prerequisite for any such matter to be escalated to any other channels within the University.   Disputes  7.1 A dispute includes a dispute over the interpretation and application of the terms of this agreement, and any collective dispute arising from the matters dealt with in this agreement. 7.2 A dispute will be declared in a written notice of the dispute. The notice must set out all details relevant to the dispute, and will also set out any possible alternatives for resolving the dispute. 7.3 The following steps will then be taken in an effort to resolve the dispute:  7.3.1 A dispute committee will be established involving at least two and not more than three senior representatives of each party to the dispute. The dispute committee will attempt to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, and within 7 (seven) days of the dispute arising, and must meet at least once during that period. 7.3.2 If the dispute is not resolved within the period referred to in 7.3.1, any party may request in writing that a mediator be appointed. A mediator will either be agreed between the parties or appointed from a panel established by UCT. 7.3.3 If the dispute is not resolved within 14 (fourteen) days of a request that a mediator be appointed, any party may refer the dispute to the CCMA. 7.3.4 The dispute will then be dealt with applying the dispute resolution provisions of the LRA, but the parties may at any stage agree to refer the dispute to further mediation, or to private arbitration.     Industrial action  8.1 The parties are familiar with and commit themselves to the principles and requirements set out in the LRA and any applicable Code of Good Practice published in terms of the LRA, and undertake to comply with the terms of any such Code as amended from time to time. 8.2 UCT and the union both commit to taking all reasonable steps to prevent any industrial action by either party that is not in compliance with the provisions of the LRA. Neither UCT nor the union will promote, support or condone any lock-out or work stoppage that is not in compliance with the LRA.   Duration of agreement and termination  9.1 This agreement will continue initially for a period of 12 months. Its provisions will be reviewed in August 2018, and it will then either be renewed on the same terms or different terms, or terminated. 9.2 Despite clause 9.1, this agreement may be terminated by any party on giving not less than 90 days’ written notice to that effect. 9.3 Any dispute over the validity of a notice to terminate will be resolved in terms of the disputes clause, clause 7 above. 9.4 For the purposes of the review in August 2018, the parties agree to increase the threshold in 3.3.5, 3.6.1 and 3.5.9.5 from 500 to 600. The parties will monitor the impact on operations of the amount of time off provided in 3.5.7.2 and 3.5.9.5. Nothing in this clause prevents any party from proposing changes to any other provision of the agreement as part of that review.   Amendments  10.1 The terms agreed can be amended only by agreement reduced to writing and signed by the parties.      Addendum to recognition and procedural agreement between the University of Cape Town (""UCT"") and National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (""NEHAWU"") (referred to as ""the main agreement"")   Despite clause 3.6.1 of the main agreement, and during the period prior to the review referred to in clause 9.4, a union that is recognized for collective bargaining in terms of clause 4.1.1   with at least 300 UCT members will receive financial support from the university in an amount equivalent to 50% of the cost of salary of a pay class 7 employee to assist the union to employ a full time shopsteward or administrator; and with at least 400 UCT members will receive financial support from the university in an amount equivalent to 75% of the cost of salary of a pay class 7 employee to assist the union to employ a full time shopsteward or administrator.   Should the union wish to pay the full time shopsteward or administrator a higher salary, the union will be required to pay such additional monies from its own funding. If the full time shopsteward or administrator is a UCT employee, and the financial support referred to in clause 3.6.1 of the main agreement read with this addendum terminates for any reason whatsoever (including the union dropping below the required threshold for the year or the full time shopsteward being replaced through a process followed by the union), the full time shopsteward will be consulted in terms of the UCT RRR Policy and may be placed on the UCT redeployment list.

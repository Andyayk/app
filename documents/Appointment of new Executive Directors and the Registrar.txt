In constituting the selection committee, the Vice-Chancellor or Deputy Vice-Chancellor consults with key constituencies across the University   2.1 As the process of constituting the selection committee is lengthy, it should begin twelve to eighteen months before the post becomes vacant.   2.2 HR, together with other administrative departments, assists the VC or DVC in compiling the selection committee.   2.3 The selection committee must include:   The Vice-Chancellor or nominee (Chair); At least one from each of the following categories:-  Executive Officers (DVCs), appointed by the Vice-Chancellor; Deans, elected by the Deans; Academic staff, appointed by the Vice-Chancellor; PASS staff (including other Executive Directors), appointed by the Vice-Chancellor; Senior staff (payclass 10 and above) of the department in question, elected by that department; Staff (below payclass 10) of the department in question, elected by that department; The department's Employment Equity Representatives (preferably two), elected by the department's Transformation Committee; External members of Council, appointed by Council; and Student representatives elected by the SRC.

Terms of reference of the selection committee include specific voting rules   3.1 The selection committee must attempt to reach consensus on a shortlist and a final candidate, voting only when this is not possible.   3.2 Where it votes, a two-thirds majority of those present will be required for a candidate to be recommended.   3.3 No member of the selection committee may vote on the final candidate if he or she was not present at an interview of all of the candidates who are considered in that vote.    Quorum  4.1 The quorum for all meetings of the selection committee is half of its full composition, which must include an employment equity representative.   Recruitment and selection procedure   Search meeting   5.1 The selection committee meets first as a search committee, to ensure that it has a common understanding of the criteria for appointment and to determine the search methods and the timeframe for the recruitment and selection process, and to finalise the advertisement and position description.   5.2 The University's Employment Equity Policy applies at all levels within the university and recruitment decisions at the senior level must show commitment to the policy. Every effort must be made to draw on the widest pool of talent available in filling the post of Executive Director.   5.3 The search methods may include advertising publicly, a direct search for an internal or external candidate, or any other appropriate course of action. In deciding on which search methods to use, the committee may consult with key constituencies.      Shortlist   5.4 The selection committee receives applications and creates a shortlist of candidates for further assessment and selection.   5.5 The selection must be based on the normal requirements of an application form, a letter of motivation, a curriculum vitae, referees' reports and any other information which the selection committee determines, but must maintain the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of its proceedings until a decision has been made on the final shortlist for interviews.      Open process prior to interviews   5.6 In an open process, staff of the department in question and other key constituencies are given the opportunity to meet the shortlisted candidates, after which feedback is provided to the selection committee.   5.7 The form of the process will be determined by the selection committee and could entail:   A public presentation to staff (which will be advertised internally in the University); and/or Visits to the department in question;    5.8 At this point the names of the shortlisted candidates will become public and each candidate on the shortlist must confirm his/her candidacy and agree to participate in the open process.   5.9 A candidate who wishes to maintain confidentiality of his/her application will understandably not wish to participate in an open process. The selection committee may then decide to forgo this step in the process for all candidates, or to proceed with the open process, in which case the candidate concerned is free to withdraw his/her application before the shortlist is made public.      Final interview and recommendation   5.10 The selection committee must interview each candidate on the final shortlist. The structure of the interview is determined by the selection committee and HR may advise the selection committee on appropriate selection methodologies to use.   5.11 The selection committee then makes a recommendation. It must make every effort to reach its decision by consensus. Failing this, a recommendation requires at least two-thirds of the members present to be in favour of the decision.    The approval procedure   Institutional Forum   6.1 The selection committee reports on the procedures followed to the Institutional Forum (IF) including steps taken to meet equity targets, but not the names of any candidates or the recommended candidate/s. The IF then submits its report to Council verifying the process that has been followed, with any further recommendations.   6.2 If the IF is not satisfied that the correct process has been followed, it must state its reasons and make suggestions as to how any actual or perceived deficiencies should be resolved as part of a dialogue with the selection committee. These matters, including outcomes, must be reported to Council, which makes the final decision on how to proceed.      Council   6.3 The selection committee submits a full report on the recruitment and selection process, together with the IF report, to Council. This report includes an abbreviated curriculum vitae of the recommended candidate/s, the selection committee's reasons for recommending that candidate and the names of the other short-listed candidates.   6.4 Every Council member has the right to inspect the full selection committee record (including all applications and referees' reports). This is made available to Council members by the HR department.   6.5 Council is entitled to take a decision in this matter by simple majority, but it may determine that a greater majority is required with respect to this particular matter. Should Council not approve the recommendation, it refers the matter back to the selection committee for further consideration.   6.6 Ordinarily, Council will decide the matter by ballot.

PASS staff.   General conditions of service   Values and principles    1.1. As an employee of the University you are required to be familiar with, and heed the UCT Mission statement and the UCT Statement of values (on the same web page).    Induction and requirements prior to taking up appointment   2.1. In the case of citizens of countries other than South Africa who do not have residency status, the appointment is offered subject to the staff member fulfilling any legal requirements in South Africa.  2.2. Qualification and criminal checks must be cleared prior to the appointment being taken up.  2.3. Academic staff must go through an induction programme prepared by the head of department, as appropriate for the position. An induction checklist is available to facilitate this process.    Agreements with the Western Cape Government   3.1. The University has agreements with the Western Cape Government for the joint operation of the teaching hospitals.  3.2. The agreements identify teaching hospitals, deal with the organisation of shared accommodation and staff and define financial arrangements.   In terms of the joint agreement with the Western Cape Government, the University compensates the Western Cape Government for the teaching performed by staff members whose salaries are paid by the Western Cape Government, and the Western Cape Government compensates the University for the clinical work performed by staff whose salaries are paid by the University, in accordance with agreed formulae. In the case of the Tripartite Agreement, Western Cape Government carries all the costs, including salaries.     Agreements with the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS)   4.1. The University has an agreement with the National Health Laboratory Service to constitute a joint staff, to regulate the work of the joint staff (of UCT and the NHLS) and to regulate access to the facilities of NHLS by UCT and vice versa.  4.2. The agreements identify academic complex laboratories, deal with the organisation of shared accommodation and staff and define financial arrangements. In terms of the agreement with the NHLS, the NHLS compensates the University for pathology services performed by joint staff whose salaries are paid by the University, in accordance with agreed formulae. The University compensates the NHLS for the teaching performed by joint staff members whose salaries are paid by the NHLS, in accordance with the Educational Services Fee.  4.3. All members of the joint UCT/NHLS staff on the payroll of the NHLS are members of the University staff. As such they are eligible for the conditions of service described in this document.    Probation and confirmation   5.1. All newly appointed, permanent joint staff on university conditions of service must fulfil probation requirements. Certain contract staff may also be required to serve probation. The normal period of probation is three years.  5.2. The probationary period tests the presumption of the appointment, namely, that there is a basis for a long term employment relationship between the member of staff and the University. It also gives the new academic the opportunity of a planned induction, training and appropriate support to gain experience and competence in teaching, research and administration so as to ensure a smooth transition from being a new staff member to becoming an established member of the University, and affords a period of adjustment for an established academic to become acquainted with the University and its academic and governance systems, and structures.  5.3. On transfer from WCG or NHLS conditions of service to university conditions of service (for example when taking up a new position), up to two years of prior service may be recognised for probation and deducted from the normal requirement of three years probation for new appointees.  See: Academic probation policy.    Heads of academic departments   6.1. Joint staff may be appointed as a Head of Department (HOD). In this pivotal position he or she provides leadership and development, and ensures that his or her department flourishes as a well-functioning academic unit.

Teaching and examination material: Joint staff are required to grant the University free licence to reproduce (for teaching and examination purposes within the University only), all teaching and examination material as they may produce in the course of their duties. This provides that such licence would be regarded as having lapsed should the material in question be published in book form by the staff member.  7.2. Research: UCT encourages research that will lead to the filing of patents for inventions. This appointment is subject to the regulations prescribed in UCT's Intellectual Property policy which deals with, amongst other issues, patents and inventions and with the rules and procedures pertaining to intellectual property and copyright ownership.  7.3. Commercialisation: In terms of UCT's Intellectual Property policy: ownership of patents and inventions vests in the University; but the benefits arising from the successful commercialisation of any patents, inventions and other non-copyright IP, are shared between the University and the inventor in accordance with the IP policy.    Additional teaching and private work   8.1. Joint staff are not permitted to engage in remunerative private work except under the RWOPS (Remunerated Work Outside the Public Service) scheme.  8.2.

None   Other An additional, block release scheme is available with its own set of criteria.             Purpose  The purpose of the policy is to:   Provide a clear model of funding for staff learning and development. Set out criteria, conditions and methods whereby staff learning and development may be funded. Ensure consistency in funding of staff learning and development throughout UCT. Ensure compliance with SARS regulations. Ensure as strong a link as possible between learning and development and position performance, thereby maximising return on investment for UCT.   Applicable to  All UCT staff on UCT conditions of service (PASS and Academic, GOB and non-GOB).  The Master's and PhD bursary scheme also applies to joint staff on either provincial or UCT conditions of service.*  This policy includes instances where the department is authorised under the Reimbursements Policy (PAY005) to pay the staff tuition rate on behalf of the staff member.  Not applicable to  Full-time and part-time joint/tripartite medical staff members not on UCT conditions of service (i.e. UCT/WCG and UCT/NHLS) are not included, with exception of the PhD and Master's bursary schemes as described above*.  This policy does not cover Study leave and Staff tuition rate.  Definitions     Term Definition   Personal learning and development need Competencies, skills, qualifications or education needed to better oneself or advance career in longer term, either at UCT or elsewhere. Not an explicit requirement of current post or requirement of any other post likely to take up in short to medium term. Competencies, skills, qualifications or education attach to person and are completely for staff member's benefit.   Developmental learning and development need Competencies, skills, qualifications or education needed to better oneself or to advance career at UCT in short to medium term. Not an explicit requirement of current post and staff member is able to attain set objectives without it. Ultimately for staff member's benefit.   Position-related learning and development need Gap between set of competencies, skills and experience necessary to reach or perform objectives, plans and goals, and those the individual currently has. Imperative that staff member develops required set in order to attain objectives. The competency, skill or experience is explicit requirement of position, and is ultimately for UCT's benefit. Can apply to one person in a team or a whole team.   Formal learning and development intervention Qualifications, certificates, degrees, diplomas. Typically are for a longer duration (3 months to a year), are formally assessed and are certified. Normally used for personal and developmental needs. Attaches to person of staff member and ultimately for staff member's benefit.*   Non-formal learning and development intervention Short skills courses offered either internally or externally. Typically are for a shorter duration (less than 3 months). Tend to specifically address one particular skill or competency, and may or may not be assessed and certified. Normally used for position-related needs. Intervention is ultimately for UCT's benefit. (E.g. First aid, MS Word or presentation skills courses). (1)   Informal learning and development intervention Reading, personal research, gathering information, coaching, mentoring. Typically used for position-related needs.     (1) Definitions consistent with those in the Income Tax Act Practice Note 17 (12 March 1993)  Principles   Link between learning and development and position performance  For learning and development to be effective and sustained and for UCT to maximise return on investment, there must be a clear link between the intervention and the position requirements, either immediately or in the short to medium term.  UCT thus supports and funds position-related and developmental but not personal interventions. However, a staff member may make use of the staff tuition rate for personal development interventions under the Staff tuition rate policy.  Taxability of learning and development funding All staff learning and development funding is subject to SARS regulations:  2.1 Should UCT pay for any personal, developmental, or position-related formal development, the staff member will be regarded as having received a taxable benefit, unless done so under a bursary agreement which converts to a loan in the case of non-compliance with the bursary stipulations.  2.2 Should UCT pay for position-related non-formal development, the staff member is not regarded as having received a taxable benefit.  Funding of learning and development per intervention type 3.1 Formal development To comply with tax regulations and for UCT to ensure a return on investment for the funding of learning and development, a bursary agreement must be entered into.  3.2 Non formal development For UCT to ensure a return on investment for the funding of expensive learning and development, a declaration of obligation may be entered into.  Funding of learning and development per learning and development need 4.1 Personal learning and development is funded in one of two ways:   For the staff members own account; or Staff tuition rates apply should the staff member pursue formal development through UCT / UWC. Staff tuition rate policy and Reimbursements policy apply.   4.2 Developmental learning and development is funded in one of three ways:   For the staff members own account; or Supported through the Staff Education Bursary Scheme in the case of staff undertaking formal development through an institution other than UCT / UWC (refer to Staff Education Bursary Scheme); or Staff tuition rates apply should the staff member pursue formal development through UCT / UWC. (Staff tuition rate policy and Reimbursements policy apply).   Specifically, a department may not fund the balance of tuition fees paid by the Staff Education Bursary Scheme. The Staff Education Bursary Scheme may only be accessed for development interventions, not position-related interventions. Only position-related interventions are funded under Funding formal development. The two are thus mutually-exclusive.  4.3 Position-related learning and development is funded in one of two ways:   Funding of formal development from departmental / faculty budgets and at line managers discretion, where the formal development is position-related (refer to Funding formal development). This includes instances where the formal development is an explicit requirement of the position and the department is authorised under the Reimbursements policy (PAY005) to pay the staff tuition rate on behalf of the staff member. Funding of non-formal development from departmental / faculty budgets and at line managers discretion. May be available internally through UCT Centres of learning (Staff Learning Centre, ICTS, CHED, Research Office, Safety, Health and Environment) or other internal programmes, in which case no or minimal cost applies. Where above R25 000, refer to Funding expensive non formal development.

In all other instances of the bursary being converted into a loan, the Executive Director Human Resources (or nominee) will instruct the payroll department, on Conversion of bursary into loan form (HR187), to enforce the bursary agreement and to convert the bursary into a loan on the date of that instruction.

There is a limit of one contract renewal, subject to performance assessment. Any renewal will be for a period not exceeding five years, thus limiting the tenure of the Directorship to no more than ten years, but could be longer if Council decides, particularly where this would take the incumbent to normal retirement age. A GSB Director recruited from within the University will have the right to return to his or her substantive academic post, in the event of the Directorship contract not being renewed. A GSB Director recruited from outside the University may be eligible for a substantive post-Directorship position, subject to a selection committee process. Specific criteria, after consultation, are used in the selection of a new Director. In constituting the selection committee, the Vice-Chancellor or a nominee from amongst the Deputy Vice-Chancellors (DVC) consults with key constituencies across the University. Terms of reference of the selection committee include specific voting rules. The quorum for all meetings of the selection committee is half of its full composition. Recruitment and selection procedure:  A selection committee meets to decide on the search methods. Applications are received and candidates shortlisted. An open process in the GSB takes place where appropriate. Shortlisted candidates undergo final interviews The selection committee makes a final recommendation.   Approval procedure:  The GSB Committees vote on a final candidate/s. The Institutional Forum (IF) verifies the selection process followed and reports to Council. Council makes the appointment.         Purpose   This policy is intended to ensure that the University identifies and appoints the best available candidate. Recognising the GSB's position as a Department within the Faculty of Commerce for academic purposes, but as an autonomous budget unit, the candidate should enjoy the necessary support of the University's Executive, Deans, Heads of Departments in the GSB and members of the Commerce Faculty. Please read together with the University's general Academic Recruitment Policy.   Applicable to   The recruitment and selection of a new GSB Director.   Not applicable to   The contract renewal of an incumbent GSB Director. See Re-appointment of incumbent GSB Director   Policy details   Appointment conditions    1.1 The initial term of appointment of a GSB Director is for five years, unless there are special circumstances.   1.2 There is a limit of one contract renewal, subject to performance assessment and the policy on Re-appointment of incumbent GSB Director.   1.3 Any renewal will be for a period not exceeding five years, thus limiting the tenure of the Directorship to no more than ten years, but could be longer if Council decides, particularly where this would take the incumbent to normal retirement age.   1.4 Where a Director is recruited from within the University, the successful candidate will have the right to return to his or her substantive academic post, in the event of the Directorship contract not being renewed.   1.5 Where a Director is recruited from outside the University, the Vice-Chancellor (VC) may, after consulting the successful candidate, recommend to a duly constituted professorial selection committee that the Director-designate be offered a substantive academic position which he or she would be entitled to assume after successfully completing his or her term(s) as a Director, should this occur prior to retirement age.    Specific criteria are used in the selection of a GSB Director   2.1 In appointing the Director, the University must seek individuals who:   are scholars of note who will have credibility among their academic peers; will offer academic leadership in the GSB, it being understood that this will include  being able to plan effectively; having the ability to inspire and innovate; having a strategic vision for the GSB; having proven leadership and management skills;   have a high profile and standing within the business and academic communities; have a commitment to transformation.    2.2 The VC or DVC consults with the Commerce Dean's Advisory Committee (DAC), the GSB's Management Committee, Academic Committee and Advisory Board on faculty and GSB-specific needs and criteria for the selection of the new Director.   2.3 The VC or DVC, with the assistance of the Human Resources department (HR) drafts the advertisement and position description taking into account the criteria identified in 2.1, and puts these to the selection committee for approval.    In constituting the selection committee, the Vice-Chancellor or Deputy Vice-Chancellor consults with key constituencies across the University   3.1 As the process of constituting the selection committee is lengthy, it should begin twelve to eighteen months before the post becomes vacant.   3.2 HR, together with other administrative departments, assists the VC or DVC in compiling the selection committee.   3.3 The VC or DVC consults the Commerce Dean's Advisory Committee, the GSB's Management Committee, Academic Committee and Advisory Board on the composition of the selection committee.   3.4 The selection committee must include:   The Vice-Chancellor or nominee (Chair); At least one from each of the following categories:  Executive Officers (DVCs), appointed by the Vice-Chancellor; Dean of Commerce; Other Deans, elected by the Deans; Executive Director of Finance, or nominee; Chair of the GSB Advisory Board; Professors in the GSB and Commerce Faculty, appointed by the VC; Non-professorial academic staff of the GSB, elected by that constituency; PASS staff in the GSB, elected by that constituency; Student representatives elected by the SRC; GSB's employment equity representatives (preferably two); External members of Council, appointed by Council.   Further members appointed by the VC in consultation with the Commerce DAC and GSB Committees to provide balance to the composition of the Committee. Where appropriate, external members (non-voting members) may be appointed by the VC for their professional or other relationship with the GSB.    3.5 Representation from each of the categories in section 3.4 above is not prescribed and the number of people from each category must be decided by the VC or DVC in consultation with the Commerce DAC and GSB Committees. In doing so the size of the committee must be kept reasonable while at the same time ensuring diversity in its composition.   3.6 No member of the selection committee may apply for, or accept nominations for the position of GSB Director.    Terms of reference of the selection committee include specific voting rules   4.1 The selection committee must attempt to reach consensus on a shortlist and a final candidate, voting only when this is not possible.   4.2 Where it votes, a two-thirds majority of those present will be required for a candidate to be recommended.   4.3 No member of the selection committee may vote on the final candidate if he or she was not present at an interview of all of the candidates who are considered in that vote.    Quorum   5.1 The quorum for all meetings of the selection committee is half of its full composition, which must include an employment equity representative.    Recruitment and selection process   Search method   6.1 The selection committee meets first as a search committee, to ensure that it has a common understanding of the criteria for appointment and to determine the search methods and the timeframe for the recruitment and selection process, and to finalise the advertisement and position description.   6.2 The University's Employment Equity Policy applies at all levels within the University and recruitment decisions at the senior level must show commitment to the policy. Every effort must be made to draw on the widest pool of talent available in filling the post of Director.   6.3 The search methods may include advertising publicly, a direct search for an internal or external candidate, or any other appropriate course of action. In coming to this decision, the committee may consult the Executive, the Deans, and the Heads of Department in the GSB (who will be expected to represent the views of the staff in their sections).   Shortlist   6.4 The selection committee receives applications and creates a shortlist of candidates for further assessment and selection.   6.5 The selection must be based on the normal requirements of a letter of motivation, a curriculum vitae, referees' reports and any other information which the selection committee determines, but must maintain the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of its proceedings until a decision has been made on the final shortlist for interviews.   Open process prior to interviews    6.6 In an open process, GSB staff are given the opportunity to meet the shortlisted candidates, after which feedback is provided to the selection committee.   6.7 The form of the process will be determined by the selection committee and could entail:   A public presentation to GSB staff and the GSB Advisory Board (which will be advertised internally in the GSB); and/or Visits to various sections within the GSB; and/or A meeting with the GSB Committees and Advisory Board.    6.8 At this point the names of the shortlisted candidates will become public and each candidate on the shortlist must confirm his/her candidacy and agree to participate in the open process.   6.9 If a candidate wishes to maintain confidentiality at this stage the selection committee may decide to forgo the open process for all candidates, or to proceed in which case the candidate concerned is free to withdraw his/her application before the shortlist is made public.   6.10 If the selection committee does decide to forgo the initial open process, and this candidate is selected as the preferred candidate, this candidate will be required to present to the GSB staff and Advisory Board. In either event, the GSB Management Committee and Academic Committee will be asked to indicate whether they would have confidence in the final candidate.   Final interview and recommendation   6.11 The selection committee must interview each candidate on the final shortlist. The structure of the interview is determined by the selection committee and HR may advise the selection committee on appropriate selection methodologies to use.   6.12 The selection committee then makes a recommendation. It must make every effort to reach its decision by consensus. Failing this, a recommendation requires at least two-thirds of the members present to be in favour of the decision.    The approval process   GSB Committees   7.1 The selection committee submits a full report on the recruitment and selection process to the GSB Management Committee and Academic Committee for consideration at a special combined meeting of these two committees. The name and curriculum vitae (but no referees' reports) of the recommended candidate/s must be made available to the members.   7.2 The special meeting is chaired by a Deputy Director. The Vice-Chancellor or nominee who chaired the selection committee presents the report and recommendation. This is done orally and a written report may be circulated in advance. Where the selection committee decides, the candidate/s may make a presentation and answer questions from the members.   7.3 The purpose of this meeting is for members to make a decision on whether they would have confidence in the candidate/s.   7.4 Members vote by secret ballot. Only members who are present at the meeting may vote and no proxy, email or postal votes may be accepted. The outgoing Director and any member of the GSB who was an applicant for the post, may not attend the meeting and may not vote.   7.5 The quorum for the meeting of the committees will be half of its full composition and a two-thirds majority vote of confidence in the candidate/s is required before the recommendation can be taken forward.   7.6 Should the candidate/s not receive a two-thirds majority vote, the selection committee must reconvene to make a decision on whether to submit its recommendation to the Institutional Forum (IF) and Council, or to return to the selection process. If the selection committee decides to proceed with its recommendation, the committees will be entitled to submit a co-report on its views to the IF and Council.   Institutional Forum   7.7 The selection committee reports on the procedures followed to the Institutional Forum (IF) including steps taken to meet equity targets, but not the names of any candidates or the recommended candidate/s. The IF then submits its report to Council verifying the process that has been followed, with any further recommendations.   7.8 If the IF is not satisfied that the correct process has been followed, it must state its reasons and make suggestions as to how any actual or perceived deficiencies should be resolved as part of a dialogue with the selection committee. These matters, including outcomes, must be reported to Council, which makes the final decision on how to proceed.   Council   7.9 The selection committee submits a full report on the recruitment and selection process, together with the GSB Committees' outcome and the IF report, to Council. This report includes an abbreviated curriculum vitae of the recommended candidate/s, the selection committee's reasons for recommending that candidate and the names of the other short-listed candidates.   7.10 Every Council member has the right to inspect the full selection committee record (including all applications and referees' reports). This is made available to Council members by the HR department.   7.11 Council is entitled to take a decision in this matter by simple majority, but it may determine that a greater majority is required with respect to this particular matter. Should Council not approve the recommendation, it refers the matter back to the selection committee for further consideration.   7.12 Ordinarily, Council will decide the matter by ballot.

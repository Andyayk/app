An acting allowance may be paid when a staff member is required to act in a more senior capacity for a continuous period of 15 working days or more, and where this is recommended by the Head of Department. An acting allowance may also be paid when a staff member is required to act in a more senior capacity for an aggregate of 22 working days or longer, during any one calendar year. In order to qualify for the acting allowance the staff member is required to assume responsibility for the full range of duties of the senior member of staff in whose place he/she is to act. The allowance amount is determined by how many payclasses above the staff member's own payclass the acting capacity falls. The acting allowance is calculated at 5% of own COE.

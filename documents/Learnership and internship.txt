Purpose  The Skills Development Act 97 of 1998 (SDA) aims to develop the skills of the South African workforce and to improve the quality of life of workers and their prospects of work. It aims to support the improvement of productivity in the workplace and the competitiveness of employers, and to promote self-employment. It also provides a framework to devise and implement national, sector and workplace strategies to develop and improve the skills of the South African workforce. To this end it makes provision for learnerships.  While the act does not regulate internships, these learning opportunities also support the aims of the act. Internships are required in some cases for the completion of a qualification, or are used to give graduates workplace exposure to enhance their chances of future employment. The aim and intention of a learnership or internship is learning and development for that learner and intern.  The purpose of the policy is to:   provide policy, process, terms and conditions for the employment of interns provide policy, process, terms and conditions for the employment of learners ensure compliance with Skills Development legislation.   Definitions     Term Definition   Learnership A supervised and structured learning programme that combines theoretical learning and practical, workplace learning of a specified nature and duration. The learning achievements are formally assessed by the accredited skills development provider/assessor. A learnership leads to a qualification registered by the South African Qualifications Authority and is related to an occupation. A Sector Education and Training Authority (SETA) establishes a learnership, and registers it with the Director-General of Labour in the prescribed manner. There is a list of registered learnerships in which one can partake. A formal learnership agreement exists between the employer, the learner and training provider.   Employed learner A person completing a learnership that was already in the employ of the University before entering into that learnership   Unemployed learner A person completing a learnership at the University of Cape Town that was unemployed before entering into that learnership.   Apprenticeship A type of learnership. The SDA defines an apprenticeship as a learnership in respect of a listed trade, and includes a trade-test in respect of that trade.   Internship A supervised and structured workplace experience programme that provides practical, on-the-job training and learning of a specified nature and duration. The internship is not registered with any external formal body (only with the Human Resources Organisational Development section). The SDA does not define or set out any specific legal requirements for an internship and it does not lead to a formal qualification.   Graduate internship A type of internship. The intern has already completed a SAQA registered qualification and requires workplace exposure to enhance their chances of future employment. The intern is given the opportunity to contextualise and apply the skills and knowledge gained during his or her studies. The learning outcomes are formalized, aligned to the relevant field, and linked to a specific position function relevant to the needs of the university. A formal employment contract exists between the employer and the intern.  (A graduate internship does not include a graduate employed on a fixed term contract with UCT, where the primary benefit of the work undertaken is for UCT's benefit. A graduate internship is run primarily for the intern's benefit and development)   Practical internship A type of internship. The intern is currently enrolled at a tertiary institution for a SAQA registered qualification, and is required to obtain workplace practical experience as part of his or her study programme. The workplace exposure gives the intern an opportunity to develop and learn new skills and knowledge relevant to the qualification. The learning outcomes are formalized and linked to the relevant qualification. A formal employment contract exists between the employer and the intern.   Mentor An experienced, qualified person who is appointed to offer advice, knowledge and insight to aid the intern's professional and personal development. The mentor could manage the internship programme of the department or faculty, or be appointed as mentor to a specific intern(s) as part of the internship programme.     Applicable to   all learnership agreements with UCT all interns employed on UCT conditions of service (PASS and academic, GOB, non-GOB and research).   Not applicable to   Joint/tripartite staff members not on UCT conditions of service (i.e. UCT/WCG and UCT/NHLS). Current students appointed as staff in roles linked to their studentship (e.g. demonstrators, tutors, sub-wardens, library assistants etcetera). Graduates employed in fixed term contracts with UCT, where the primary benefit of the work undertaken is for UCT's benefit. These are considered fixed term or ad hoc employees.

UCT supports PASS staff members undertaking developmental formal learning and development, through the provision of study and examination leave. Study and examination leave is to be used for the explicit purpose of preparing for examination or for the examination itself.  1.2. A leave of absence to attend developmental formal learning and development may be granted by the line manager. Subject to the approval of the line manager, provided that the staff member provides the line manager with a lecture timetable, provided that the time is made up to his/her satisfaction, and provided that operational requirements allow it, a staff member may be permitted to attend five lectures weekly. In this instance, lectures refer to normal short lectures of an hour or so each.  1.3. A leave of absence to attend or to be assessed for position-related learning and development is at the discretion of the line manager. This is treated as a normal working day and not as leave.  1.4. Study and examination leave will not be granted where the learning and development is of a personal nature. In this case, annual leave must be used.  1.5. Study and examination leave will not be granted where the learning and development is non-formal or informal, as these typically do not undergo formal assessment requiring dedicated preparation time.    Eligibility   2.1 The policy applies to PASS staff undertaking formal developmental learning and development and who wish to apply for a leave of absence to prepare for an examination and the examination itself.    Criteria   3.1 To qualify, the course of study must meet the following criteria:   The course is formal in nature; and The course is examined or formally assessed; and The course is done through a recognised, reputable institution; and The course is developmental or position-related; and The course was identified as part of the Development Dialogue (DD) process.     Period   4.1 Up to 12 days study and examination leave may be granted in any one calendar year in total in the following two categories combined:  4.2 Preparation purposes    4.2.1 One day study and examination leave may be granted per examination in order to prepare for a written or oral examination, up to a maximum of 6 days.  4.2.2 Up to 6 days study and examination leave will be granted to prepare written submission for formal examination where this submission is the main form of examination.  4.2.3 In the case of PhD or Masters, up to 12 days study and examination leave will be granted to prepare written submission for formal examination where this submission is the main form of examination.  4.2.4 Any further leave required must be taken as annual leave.    4.3 Examination purposes    4.3.1 One day study and examination leave may be granted per examination for the examination itself where the examination falls within normal working hours.  4.3.2 Where an examination is taken in the morning, only half a day's study and examination leave will be granted, and the staff member will be required to return to work for the afternoon  4.3.3 Where an examination falls outside of normal working hours (e.g. evenings and weekends), study and examination leave for the examination will not be granted.      Accrual   5.1 There is no accrual of study and examination leave.  5.2 There is no entitlement to study and examination leave.  5.3 For part-time staff, the number of study and examination leave days is reduced according to their normal work schedule.      Example A Part-time staff whose working day is less than the full 7.5 hours per day may be granted 12 days of study and examination leave where each leave day is based on the same number of hours they would normally have worked.  Example B Part-time staff working less than 5 days per week may be granted study and examination leave calculated on a pro-rata basis according to the percentage time worked. Therefore a staff member who works 4 days per week (80% of the week) may be granted 80% of the study and examination leave, 9.6 days.        Procedures   6.1 Application   Applications must be made online on Employee Self-Service or on the leave form (HR140). Applications must be made to the line manager. Original or certified copy of the examination timetable, or a letter from the institution outlining the examination process and/or dates, or an original letter from the lecturer/supervisor supporting leave in the case of written submission, must be attached to the leave form. Leave may not be taken without prior approval. Approved leave forms are forwarded to the Human Resources Department for record keeping on the payroll system.  Online leave applications are stored on the payroll system following approval by the line manager.   6.2 Authority and approval   Study and examination leave for preparation purposes must, within reason, be taken at times operationally convenient to the department and as such may not always be granted for the days directly before the examination. Operational requirements must be taken into account. Flexible working hours may also be considered.

There is no limit to the number of contract renewals, which are subject to performance assessments. The Vice-Chancellor (VC) establishes whether the DVC wishes to be considered for re-appointment. If yes, the VC conducts a performance review and consults with key stakeholders. The VC either proposes a renewal, extension, or full recruitment process. The VC submits a proposal to Senate for a vote. The Institutional Forum verifies the above process and makes a recommendation to Council. The Council decides whether to make a re-appointment.       Applicable to   A Deputy Vice-Chancellor whose term of office is due to expire.   Not applicable to   The appointment of a new Deputy Vice-Chancellor.

The staff tuition rate varies from 25% to 100% of the normal fee.  4.  Policy principles  4.1.  Children and spouses/partners of eligible staff qualify for a staff tuition rate. The child must be financially-dependant on the staff member.  4.2.  The University Council has determined that students who qualify for both the staff tuition rate and a scholarship/bursary, will have their fee account adjusted  4.3.  The relationship as child is the dominant and necessary condition, and if this is fulfilled, the further necessary condition is that the child be financially dependent on the staff member.  4.4.  The staff tuition rate applies for courses which are credited towards formal qualifications (such as degrees and diplomas). The staff tuition rate also applies for staff members on an individual subsidy-earning course that gives credit towards a formal qualification.  4.5.  Where students are staff, they qualify for a special staff tuition rate in their own right in all cases, other than those where the fee has already been reduced.  4.6.  Staff tuition rates for spouses/life partners and dependent children are for full-time study.  4.7.  In the case of retirees, widows and widowers of deceased staff, the definition of spouse/partner and dependants applies to the relationship at the retirement date or date of death of the staff member.  4.8.  UCT has an historical reciprocal agreement with the University of the Western Cape (for staff member and children only). This does not apply to any other tertiary institutions.  4.9.  The staff tuition rates are applicable only while the listed conditions outlined below apply.  4.10.

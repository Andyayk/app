The University Council stipulates that every permanent member of staff, whether fixed term or contract (3 months or longer), should be issued with a valid UCT identity card bearing his/her photograph, surname, first names and department.  Staff are required to carry the identity card with them at all times while on University property and to produce it when asked to do so by an officer of Campus Protection Services or any other authorised member of the University community.  Staff taking up employment with the University for the first time, may collect an identity card from the Access Control Office which is located in the new Properties and Services Building, directly above the Traffic Office on Upper Campus. The operating hours are: 08h00 - 16h30 (week days ONLY). Please take along positive identification e.g. proof of employment, RSA ID document, RSA driver's licence, passport.  In the event of a staff member losing his/her card, a replacement card may be requested at a cost of R120. Payment must be made by cash/credit card to the cashier in the Kramer Building. Proof of payment must be presented to Access Control Services before the lost card is replaced with a new one.  Staff leaving the employ of the University must return their staff card to the HR Department.  Page last updated: 27 January 2015 Page last reviewed: 12 January 2017    Share on

Overview | Qualifying for the UCT medical aid subsidy | Post-retirement medical aid subsidy | Death in service medical aid subsidy | Calculation of the subsidy percentage | Subsidy details  Overview  The UCT medical aid subsidy is available for qualifying permanent staff members appointed before 1 January 2018, new staff members appointed from 1 January 2018 do not qualify. The subsidy is available as either a post-retirement benefit or in the case of a current staff member’s death, a benefit for their dependants.  Qualifying for the UCT medical aid subsidy  To qualify for the post-retirement subsidy, the staff member must:   Be a permanent staff member, appointed before 1 January 2018. Be a main member on the UCT medical aid scheme. If on an external registered South African medical aid scheme as either the main member or a spouse/partner dependant, the staff member must move back to the UCT medical aid scheme before retirement. This move may incur penalties, waiting periods and/or exclusions as determined by the University’s medical aid scheme. If not continuously on the UCT medical aid scheme, provide proof of continuous medical aid cover for the entire employment period.   To qualify for the death in service subsidy, the staff member must have been:   A permanent staff member, appointed before 1 January 2018. A main member on the UCT medical aid scheme (if previously on an external registered South African medical aid scheme, proof of continuous medical aid cover for the entire employment period is required).   Post retirement medical aid subsidy  When retired staff members return to UCT on appointment with benefits, i.e. in either a T2 or permanent capacity, the subsidy will be suspended during the period of employment. Ad hoc and T1 capacity contracts will retain the subsidy as these contract conditions do not include entitlement to benefits.  Death in service medical aid subsidy  Membership to the UCT medical aid scheme will continue, the spouse dependant (in the absence of a spouse dependant, the eldest child dependant) will become the main member. The UCT subsidy, calculated based on the deceased member's employment period, will be applied to the new membership (provided proof received of continuous medical aid cover). In the event of a beneficiary of a deceased member taking up appointment at UCT, the beneficiary should be entitled to continue receiving the subsidy.  Calculation of the subsidy percentage  For qualifying permanent staff members appointed between 1 June 2000 and 31 December 2017, the subsidy is 2% per year of service, up to a maximum of 50% of the cost of the subscription for the UCT medical aid scheme.  For qualifying permanent staff members appointed before 1 June 2000, there is no link between medical aid subsidy and years of service and they are automatically entitled to a 50% subsidy of the cost of the subscription for the UCT medical aid scheme.  Subsidy details  The UCT medical aid scheme is currently Discovery Health. The subsidised option, reviewed annually by Council, is the Coastal Saver plan with maximum savings.  The subsidy is applied as per the membership size and the dependants listed as at the time of retirement or death. Exceptions to this are:   Only a spouse/partner dependant and/or child dependant are eligible to be covered by the subsidy. No other adult dependant is covered, but may continue on the membership. No grandchild can be covered by the subsidy.

If the premiums fall behind and no contact is made to correct bank details and settle the arrears in full, the membership will be removed from the UCT account. The subsidy eligibility will fall away and the member will be required to transfer to private capacity to continue medical aid cover.  If a spouse, partner, adult dependant, child or grandchild is added to the membership after retirement or death, the subsidy will not be extended to this dependant. When a child dependant turns 21 (adult status), their subsidy will automatically fall away. If the membership no longer contains anyone that qualifies for the subsidy, the membership will be moved into private capacity.  In the case of death of a main member receiving the subsidy (e.g. retired staff member, spouse/partner of deceased staff member), any dependants receiving the subsidy remain eligible.  Any changes to the membership will continue to be managed via the UCT Healthcare Specialist:  Debra De Gouveia-Meyer Fax: 021 650-2968 Tel: 021 650-4001 E-mail: debra.degouveia-meyer@uct.ac.za Internal mail: Debra De Gouveia-Meyer, Rm 113.1, Bremner Building  Page last updated: 22 October 2018    Share on

1.4.1. The retirement age is deferred indefinitely for A- and B1-rated researchers whose posts are fully funded by the University. Should the post not be fully funded by UCT, arrangements will need to be negotiated with the DVC for academic affairs.    1.4.2. Where application for rating is under way, appointments would continue and be deferred or terminated thereafter based on the result of the ranking.    1.4.3. Eligible staff qualify for deferment automatically but must have the support of both the Head of Department and Dean.    1.4.4. Final approval is given by the DVC Academic and the Vice-Chancellor.    1.4.5. Eligible staff continue their substantive roles as permanent, full-time academics with a work load to be determined by the Head of Department, which can be negotiated but which must include the requirement to mentor younger academic staff.    1.4.6. Staff on deferred retirement remain on permanent academic conditions of service, however disability insurance falls away at the end of the year the person turns 65 and Group Life Assurance cover falls away at age 70. As these insurance premiums fall away, the resultant premium savings will be channelled to the staff member’s retirement savings.    1.4.7. If the A or B1-rating is not renewed, the deferment falls away and the person is required to retire at the end of that year.s

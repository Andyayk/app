Annual leave subsections:    3.1 Permanent and T2 academic and joint staff  3.2 Permanent and T2 PASS staff  3.3 PASS and academic staff on T1 contracts  3.4 Part time staff and parts of a month  3.5 Conversion of annual to sick leave  3.6 Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff  3.1. Permanent and T2 academic and joint staff    Accrual and carry over    3.1.1. The number of annual leave days which accrue each year is 22, to be taken each calendar year in agreement with the Head of Department in general and with the Dean for Heads of Department. In setting the guidelines of 22 days per annum, the University recognises that academics ordinarily do not work during the period between Christmas and New Year (23 December – 31 December). Where the staff member is required to work in this period, the corresponding number of working days is granted as leave during the year, to be arranged in advance as no leave is carried forward to the following year.    Application and taking of annual leave    3.1.2. Academic staff wishing to take annual leave must obtain approval from the Head of Department. A form is not required centrally but records must be kept in the department.    3.1.3. Approval of leave rests with the line manager or HOD provided that operational requirements allow for it. If a Head of Department, approval is given by the Dean and if a Dean by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor nominated for this purpose by the Vice-Chancellor.    3.2. Permanent and T2 PASS staff    Accrual and carry over    3.2.1. Annual leave accrues monthly at the rate of 2.17 or 2.83 days, based on 26 or 34 working days per annum in calendar year cycles (see summary table).    3.2.2. Depending on the level of staff, annual leave is made up of (see summary table):    PC 1 - 12: 19 compulsory leave days and 7 accumulative leave days  PC 13 peromnes grade 4-5: 18 compulsory leave days and 8 accumulative leave days  Executive Directors and The Registrar: 26 compulsory leave days and 8 accumulative leave days  3.2.3. Staff employed prior to 1977 who are entitled to long leave (a historical type of leave which has been discontinued) are not entitled to accumulative annual leave.    3.2.4. A staff member may not take leave before it has accrued. He or she may take annual leave in the year in which he or she earns it, or in the calendar year following the year in which he or she earns it (for T2, by end of June of the following year).    Example  A member of staff who joins on 1 January of a given year will be allowed to take annual leave that has accrued to a particular moment in time. In other words, if he or she wanted to take leave in June, 13 days would be available (2.17 days per month x 6 months).    3.2.5. Accrued compulsory annual leave not taken by the end of the following calendar year is lost (for T2, by end of June of the following year), unless the Head of Department can show, via a written motivation to the satisfaction of the Executive Director: HR that there were good operational reasons why the leave could not be taken. Leave to be postponed in this way must be requested before completion of the calendar year concerned and must be taken as early as possible in the following year.    3.2.6. Accumulative annual leave (permanent only, not T2) has the following maximums, which may be carried over indefinitely:    Staff grouping	Maximum accumulative leave  PC 1-4	up to 28  PC 5-12	up to 42  PC 13 PG 4-5  PC 13 PG 3 (EDs and Registrar)	up to 50  3.2.7. Once the maximum has been reached, accumulative leave is accrued as compulsory leave and must be used as per 3.2.5.    Application for annual leave    3.2.8. PASS staff wishing to take annual leave must apply to their line manager, using the standard leave application form (HR140).    3.2.9. The decision to grant leave rests with the line manager provided that operational requirements reasonably allow for it and the staff member has leave due to him/her.    Taking of leave    3.2.10. The maximum leave that can be taken at any one time is 50 working days.    3.2.11. Staff who take leave between the Day of Goodwill (26th December) and New Year's day must apply for leave in the usual way.    3.2.12. A staff member is not permitted to take annual leave in excess of his or her total leave credit (i.e. current accrual of compulsory leave plus any accumulated leave). Any leave taken in excess of this will be unpaid leave (see: Unpaid leave).    3.2.13. A Head of Department may refuse to grant leave during a staff member's notice period, prior to resignation.    3.3. PASS and academic staff on T1 contracts    3.3.1. In line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, 1.25 days per month worked (or 15 working days per year from the anniversary date) is accrued as annual leave.    3.3.2. Only leave which has accrued to date may be taken as annual leave.    3.4. Part-time staff and parts of a month    3.4.1. For part-time staff, leave is accrued as per 3.1. (academic and joint staff), 3.2. (PASS) or 3.3. (T1 contracts) and pro-rated as follows:    Working..	Earns..  1 day per week	20% of the full-time entitlement  2 days per week	40% of the full-time entitlement  3 days per week	60% of the full-time entitlement  4 days per week	80% of the full-time entitlement  This calculation also applies to the other types of leave.  3.4.2. If a person works part of a month, annual leave entitlement is calculated as follows:    Formula	 	Full-time entitlement  ÷	Calendar days in the month  x	Calendar days employed  Worked example:  A staff member starts work on November 10.	 	2.17 days  ÷	30 days  x	21 days  =	1.5 days [Result]  3.5. Conversion of annual leave to sick leave    3.5.1. Annual leave may be converted to sick leave under exceptional circumstances only. A written motivation with HOD/line manager’s support must be supplied as well as a medical certificate, and final approval rests with the EDHR.    3.6. Ad hoc and paid-on-claim staff    3.6.1. In line with the BCEA, leave accrues at the rate of 1 hour per 17 hours worked, provided the staff member works more than 24 hours in the month.    3.6.2. Leave may be taken subject to approval during the contract, or the hours claimed as leave pay on a monthly basis.
